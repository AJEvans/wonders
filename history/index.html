Nennius' <I>Historia</I> has largely been cast aside as 
near useless for historical study, though it is 
both an interesting reflection on issues important in 
the 9/10th 
Century<A href="../references/Dumville1986Value.html" target=bottom>*</A><A href="../references/CharlesEdwards1991Welsh.html" target=bottom>*</A>, and 
well constructed given the limitations of the age<SUP><A href="notes/suffer.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>.
Most interest in the work comes from the fact that it contains 
a number of dubious details on 
King Arthur<SUP><A href="notes/arthur.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>. 
</P>
<P>
Nennius professed he made a "heap of all that [he] 
found"<SUP><A href="notes/sources.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP>, so 
the work is perhaps best regarded as a "Reader" in Dark Age 
History<A href="../references/Morris1980Nennius.html" target=bottom>*</A><A href="../references/CharlesEdwards1991Welsh.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
The Wonders (and associated list of 
cities<SUP><A href="notes/cities.html" target=bottom>4</A></SUP>) in particular, are widely 
excepted as an inserted older work<SUP><A href="notes/additions.html" target=bottom>5</A></SUP>.

<P>
Different manuscripts have different Wonders in them, but the list on the 
left tries to cover them all. In addition, in most cases the locations 
of the Wonders were latinized in the manuscripts, and it is hard to 
locate some. This site follows the most likely 
options<SUP><A href="notes/locations.html" target=bottom>6</A></SUP>. The following 
links give further details that might be of interest.
