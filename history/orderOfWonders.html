Durham University Library has alternative text(s), details of which 
you can find <A href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/library/asc/misc/medmss/apvv4.htm" target=_new>here</A> (search for "Mirabilia britannie"). Sketchy at the moment, but it appears there are two versions here, including the following wonders: Version A, Wonder 1) The lake "lumonoi", with islands, which is as we have, and Version B, Wonders 1) <A href="http://beehive.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/default.asp?WCI=SiteHome&ID=7602&PageID=40524" target=_new>Cheddar hole</A>, 2) Rolendriht (<A href="http://www.rollrightstones.co.uk/" target=_new>Rollright stones</A>?) 3) The White Horse (presumable 
<A href="http://wiltshirewhitehorses.org.uk/uffington.html" target=_new>Uffington</A>: if, as the librarian claims, this section was added as late as the 17th C. this could have been another <A href="http://www.hows.org.uk/personal/hillfigs/main.htm" target=_new>horse</A>, however most were carved in the 18-19th C.) and 13) 
<A href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/stonehenge/" target=_new>Stonehenge</A>.
