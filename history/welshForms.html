Most of the placenames are in Old Welsh (pre-12th C.) at the latest, though may 
in places may go back to late Brythonic (pre-7th C.). Of course, an early spelling 
doesn't necessarily mean the manuscript was written at the time. In 
the absence of any written place-record to ossify placenames, as our current 
maps do, it might be expected that contemporary spelling would be used. However, we know 
from the Book of Llan D&#226;v (See <A href="otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>) 
that parish boundary documents recorded placenames from at least 
the Old Welsh period onwards.

Here are some of the pertinent spelling variations (from Strachan<A href="../references/Strachan1909Early.html" target=bottom>*</A>, unless 
otherwise indicated):
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Modern and Middle Welsh <I>Ll</I> was written <I>L</I> at the start of Old Welsh words, eg. 
<I>Lin Liuan</I> but <I>ll</I> elsewhere. There was also a pronounciation change for this form from "L" to 
the current "Lth" in the 10th C.<A href="../references/Griffen1994Names.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
</LI>
<LI>
The "u" sound, 
written <I>w</I> in Modern Welsh was written <I>u</I> in Old Welsh, but 
also (along with <I>v</I>, <I>6</I> and <I>w</I>) in Middle Welsh. However, the "i" sound 
was already in Old Welsh starting to be written <I>u</I>. In Middle Welsh this was 
also written as <I>v</I>. 
</LI>

<LI>
The "i" sound, 
written <I>y</I> in Modern Welsh was written <I>i</I> in Old Welsh, but 
also (along with <I>y</I>, dotted-<I>y</I>, and <I>e</I>) in Middle Welsh. 
The "y" sound was also written <I>i</I> in Old Welsh, while in Middle Welsh 
it is <I>i</I> or <I>y</I>.
</LI>

<LI>The "w" sound in Old Welsh is written <I>u</I>, but in Middle Welsh <I>w</I>, <I>6</I>, 
<I>u</I>, or <I>v</I>. In both <I>wy</I> is sometimes replaced with <I>oy</I>. 
The Old Welsh <I>guo-</I> becomes <I>go-</I>, while <I>gu</I> becomes "w", written 
<I>6</I>, <I>w</I>, <I>u</I>, <I>uu</I> or <I>v</I>. The Brythonic <I>sv</I> 
becomes <I>hw</I> in Old Welsh, and <I>chw</I> in Middle Welsh; likewise 
<I>w</I> becomes the Old Welsh <I>hw</I> and Middle Welsh <I>gw</I>.
</LI>
<LI>
<I>p</I> and <I>b</I> within words are pretty interchangable in Old and Middle Welsh.
</LI>
<LI>
The Old Welsh <I>c</I> is later replaced with <I>k</I> in Middle Welsh, though 
<I>c</I> is also found.
</LI>
<LI>The "spirant-v" in Middle Welsh is written <I>u</I>, <I>uu</I>, <I>v</I>, <I>fu</I>, <I>w</I>, and, 
as in Modern Welsh <I>f</I> (pronouced "vh"). In Old Welsh this appears to be written <I>m</I>.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Examples of dictation and transcription errors can be found in classic Welsh texts, for example, 
<I>Culhwch ac Olwen</I> (<A href="../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target=bottom>*</A> page xvi), so 
we should be little surprised to find them here, though we await Vol.10 of Dumville's <I>The Historia Brittonum</I> 
(see <A href="translations.html" target=right>Translations</A>) which he 
notes<A href="../references/Dumville1986Value.html" target=bottom>*</A> will contain a full study by K.H.Jackson of the Welsh language forms.
