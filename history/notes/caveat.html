Note that this list is compiled from a number of sources (see ID column), and they 
often refer to the same manuscripts in different ways, so there is no 
guarantee that some of the manuscripts listed are still not the same. It is 
also perfectly possible that someone has come up with a definitive list 
we haven't yet tracked down.
