NB: Most of the texts on the web are, by their very nature, out of copyright, 
and therefore old. Many of the translations are now considered imperfect, though 
they are often still regarded as classics despite this.

Apologies also for the lack of references here, it's not intended to 
be definitive. There is an excellent summary of references for the 
Arthurian material by Tom Green <A href="http://www.arthuriana.co.uk/concepts/arthlit.htm" target=_new>here</A> if you 
are interested.
