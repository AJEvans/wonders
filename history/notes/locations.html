In each case the locations taken are either those suggested by a number of 
exegetists, sites locally connected with the Wonders, or, when very 
desperate, the lone suggestion of anyone who cares to make one. 
While specifics can be found in the notes for each Wonder, it should 
generally be noted that the attribution of 'Dark Age' names to modern locations 
has been a study rampant with misuse and over-interpretation 
(see, for critiques, Newell<A href="../../references/Newell1905Doubts.html">*</A>, 
Bromwich<A href="../../references/Bromwich1975Concepts.html">*</A>, or 
Thomas Green's<A href="../../references/Green2004Historicity.html">*</A>  
<A href="http://www.arthuriana.co.uk/historicity/arthnote.htm#battles" target=_new>note</A>, 
on the fight to host Arthur's battles). 
Good online Gazetteers for 'Dark Age' Britain are
