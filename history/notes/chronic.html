The "Chronicle"<A href="../../references/Wright1887Gloucester.html">*</A> is a work of general history, apparently 
compiled from other sources and rendered in verse. Its chief delight 
(and use) is that it is in English rather than Latin.

The Rolls Series editor for the Chronical, William Aldis Wright 
(<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Aldis_Wright" target=_new>biography</A>), obviously lost the will 
to live someway through the job, as his terse introduction makes clear.   
He notes: "As literature, it is as worthless as twelve thousand lines of verse 
without one spark of poetry can be. Here and there we find a trace of the quiet 
humour in which gentle dulness delights, but of this the instances are rare 
and wide scattered".
