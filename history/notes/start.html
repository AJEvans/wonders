From Gildas and then Bede onwards (See 
<A href="../../introduction/index.html" target=right>Introduction</A> 
<A href="../../introduction/notes/geographical.html" target=bottom>Note</A>) 
it was popular for indigenous historians to start their works with a general geography of Britain. 
Bede's opening contained a number of wonders (though not explicitly listed as such), 
including hot baths and salt springs (making one consider whether Bede had access to the 
<I>Historia</I> list before its inclusion in the manuscripts we have today, and summarized it). 
The <I>Historia</I>'s list is much more explicitly about Wonders. This  
seems to have inspired many later historians, very reasonably, to combine the geography and wonders into 
a single prologue for their works, often including other geographical lists such 
as the cities of Britain (<A href="cities.html">Note</A>) or lists of the most important rivers.

In some cases, however, an alternative list seems to have been circulating, comprising of 
Peak Cavern and/or Chedderhole, Stonehenge and/or other stone circles, and orographic rainfall! 
In the case of the first of these, the list usually mentions a strong wind blowing from 
it, which doesn't seem to be the case for Peak Cavern (see 
<A href="../../wonder9/index.html" target=right>Wonder 9</A> 
<A href="../../wonder9/myth.html" target=right>Myth</A>), strongly suggesting the adaptation 
of the <I>Historia</I> list for a more English audience.
