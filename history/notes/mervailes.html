Verses on the wonders of Britain are mentioned by Camden<a href="../../references/Camden1607Britannia.html" target=bottom>*</a>: <a href="http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/lincseng.html#derb9" target="_new">Darbyshire</a>). Though there is no indication of a title, Holland's translation has 
"Verses... touching the Mervailes of England", which seems as good as any for now...
