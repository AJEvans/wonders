Some references state that the Wonders are quoted in the 
manuscripts as additions of earlier material, but evidence 
of this is unforthcoming. Despite this, most who comment 
on the origin of the Wonders have suggested they are additions, 
for example Thomson<A href="../../references/Thomson1982British.html">*</A> and 
Dumville<A href="../../references/Dumville1986Value.html">*</A>. The latter 
suggests a detailed study by K.H.Jackson based Welsh language forms 
will be available in Vol.10 of his <I>The Historia Brittonum</I> 
(see <A href="../translations.html" target=right>Translations</A>).

Morris<A href="../../references/Morris1980Nennius.html" target=bottom>*</A> has suggested that the repetition of the Severn Bore in several places 
(Wonders 2; 5; 6; and 11) indicates that the author conflated several different 
sources for his list. While this could just be true of 2 and 6, the others are 
very different features of the same phenomena. The recurrence could, for example,
just as easily indicate a Triad on "The Wonders of the Severn Bore" 
(See <A href="../../introduction/notes/themes.html">Note</A> to <A href="../../leftalt1.html" target=left>Menu&nbsp;by&nbsp;Theme</A>).
