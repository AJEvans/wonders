The <I>Abbreviationes chronicorum</I> 
contains <I>De Mirabilibus Britanniae</I> (The Wonders of Britain). The Latin text, with annotations and notes on sources in English can be found in Stubbs<A href="../../references/Stubbs1876Ralph.html">*</A>
(<A href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/library/asc/misc/medmss/apvv4.htm" target=_new>alternative text</A>). 
</P>
<P>
Note that this set of wonders is likely to be, as is most of the <I>Abbrviationes</I>, a compliation of other sources, including Nennius. There is no discussion of this particular section of the work by 
Stubbs<A href="../../references/Stubbs1876Ralph.html">*</A> in his introductory material, 
though he does talk more generally about de Diceto's background (Vol.i) and sources (Vol.ii).
