Pen.50 is of interest in that it contains a good deal of probably very old Welsh material. This manuscript 
lists the "Names of the Island of Britain" and the "Cities of Britain". In the "Names" section (which 
can be found in Bromwich<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>App.1) it 
gives the information that there are "Thirty Four Chief Marvels" in Britain, and it apparently lists these after the Welsh triads 
(<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>p.cxxiii).
The fact that there are 34 wonders is also given in the Welsh "White Book" in the same section. The "Red Book" 
omits this reference. While there doesn't seem to be a printed version of Pen.50, it was used to make 
Pen.185, which was, in turn, copied into BM.Addl. 14,873, which was printed in the <I>Myvyrian</I> 
(see <A href="../otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>). The list may also be given in Pen.163.
