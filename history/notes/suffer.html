Nennius has always suffered by comparison with Gildas 
(<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gildas" target=_new>Biography</A>; 
<A href="../otherWorks.html" target="right">Other Works</A>), who, for one 
reason or another doesn't taint his work by mentioning 
Arthur (he didn't exist; he murdered his brother), and Bede 
(<A href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02384a.htm" target=_new>Biography</A>; 
<A href="../otherWorks.html" target="right">Other Works</A>) who 
attempted a more specific history from more tightly constrained 
sources. You can find a robust defense of Nennius and his "Reader" 
when compared with other historians in 
Morris<A href="../../references/Morris1980Nennius.html" target=bottom>*</A>, 
Dumville<A href="../../references/Dumville1986Value.html">*</A>, and 
Dumville's 'Historia Brittonum: an Insular History from the Carolingian Age' 
(quoted in the   
<A href="http://www.arthuriana.co.uk/historicity/arthnote.htm#Dumville1994" target=_new>
notes</A> to Green<A href="../../references/Green2004Historicity.html" target=bottom>*</A>).
