The 33 (or, in the Harleian <A href="../manuscripts.html" target=right>Manuscripts</A>, 28) 
cities listed, and possible translations of their names can be found in 
the Giles<A href="../../references/Giles1891Six.html" target=bottom>*</A> translation <A href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/nennius-full.html" target=_new>here</A> (this varies in the online versions because  
some of the English names given didn't appear in the earlier 
Giles<A href="../../references/Giles1841GildasNennius.html" target=bottom>*</A>,  specifically: 3,4,8,9,10,11,13,21,29,30,32,33). Gildas (see <A href="../otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>) 
notes that Britain in his time is famous for its 28 cities, though 
doesn't list them. Ptolemy, in the 2nd&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN>, lists 58 in his <I>Geographike hyphegesis</I> ("Guide to Geography": see 
<A href="../otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>), though 
what counted as a city can be judged by the inclusion of Ilkley (<I>Olicana</I>: 
though see Rivet and Smith<A href="../../references/Rivet1979Placenames.html">*</A>)...

<P>  
As mentioned in note <A href="locations.html" target=bottom>6</A>, 
the attribution of modern names to 'Dark Age' locations is notoriously tricky. 
There is, for example, a recent alternative attempt by 
Ford<A href="../../references/Ford2001Cities.html" target=bottom>*</A>, 
(though note that it is hard to say what sources it is based on).
