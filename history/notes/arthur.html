Specifically the <I>Historia</I> lists a series of battles it 
attributes to Arthur, and he is mentioned as associated with some of 
the Wonders. The best source for references to Arthur in early British 
literature is Coe and Young<A href="../../references/CoeYoung1995Sources.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(translations and facsimilies - though note, this is largely extracts, not complete works) but good websites 
include Thomas Green's <A href="http://www.arthuriana.co.uk/" target=new>Arthurian Resources</A>, 
Mary Jones' <A href="http://www.geocities.com/branwaedd/hbindex.html" target=_new>T&#375;'r Beirdd</A>  
or <A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/index.html" target=_new>Celtic Literature Collection</A> 
(the same site, but updated at different times), and 
the <A href="http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/" target=_new>Camelot Project</A>.
