One or other of the two whirlpool pools are marked on most old maps of the area (though 
rarely both, save on the 1775 <A href="sale.html">Map</A>) as Whirlpools or "Whirly Pools". 
This <A href="whirlpools.html" target=right>Map</A> shows their relationship 
to the major features in the 1880s, and here's the modern <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=346000&Y=190000&width=500&height=300&gride=348417.415375845&gridn=188324.696592512&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&right.x=512&right.y=172" target=_new class=place>Map</A> (see also these 1800s Tithe Maps: 
<A href="tithe1.html" target=right>Map&nbsp;1</A>; 
<A href="tithe2.html" target=right>Map&nbsp;2</A>). 

The pools were actually resurgencies (ie. where water that has gone underground elsewhere wells up). 
As water disappeared from the Troggy into the limestone of the area at 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=344000&Y=192000&width=500&height=300&gride=348417.415375845&gridn=188324.696592512&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&right.x=510&right.y=170" target=_new class=place>Llanmellin</A>, it is felt that 
they were probably resurgencies of this water, though it is not clear whether any 
kind of proof of this was ever gained<SUP><A href="notes/resurgence.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>.

As mentioned, there have been two major reorganisations of the Troggy: the first was the 
diversion at some point c.1600 <SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN> or before of the stream below 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=348000&Y=188000&width=500&height=300&gride=348417.415375845&gridn=188324.696592512&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&right.x=513&right.y=166" target=_new class=place>Deepweir</A> from Sudbrook to Caldicot Pill. The second, and more 
important here, was the major concreting of the whole catchment as part of the building of 
the Severn tunnel.

The building of the Severn tunnel went largely without incident until 18th October 1879, when 
the tunnellers on the Welsh side hit a large freshwater-filled fissure which 
flooded the tunnel to the roof: at its maximum discharging some 1,200,000 gallons per hour (5681.25&nbsp;m<SUP>3</SUP>h<SUP>-1</SUP>)<SUP><A href="notes/spring.html" 
target=bottom>2</A></SUP>. 
After this "Severn Tunnel Great Spring" opened, engineer Thomas A. Walker 
(<A href="http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/item1/7022" target=_new class=photo>Photo</A>: <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_A._Walker_%28engineer%29" target=new>Biography</A>) 
was contracted to solve the 
problem<A href="../references/Daniel2000Tunnel.html" target=bottom>*</A>. Years of extremely dangerous and inventive diving saw the spring plugged in the 
tunnel<A href="../references/Farr1999Strongman.html" target=bottom>*</A>, however, to reduce the amount of water entering it, the chief engineer 
decided to seal the places the water was entering the geology. As the Spring was under  
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=348000&Y=188000&width=500&height=300&gride=348417.415375845&gridn=188324.696592512&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&right.x=513&right.y=166" target=_new class=place>Portskewett</A>, this meant concreting the floor of the Troggy 
and any holes along its length, possibly including the whirlpools<SUP><A href="notes/control.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP>.
</P>
<P>
This may seem weird (why cap somewhere where the water is leaving the ground? Indeed, why call somewhere where water is coming out a whirlpool?) however, the strange nature of the whirlpools may explain this.
