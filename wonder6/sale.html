1775 Map (Caldicot Lordship Sale)<A href="../references/Nettleship2006Whirly1.html" target=bottom>*</A>. Note that this is one of the few maps to mark both “Whirlpools”. 
The parish boundary (dotted) probably follows the c.700&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN> 
course set by Brockwael<A href="../references/Nettleship2006Whirly1.html" target=bottom>*</A>. The transfer and 
description of the boundary from the Book of Llan D&#226;v (c.895 <SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../references/Rippon1996Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A>) don't mention 
the whirlpools (<A href="notes/troggy.html" target=bottom>Note</A>). However, note that by the eastern-most 
whirlpool there is a notable kink in the boundary running from the main stream up to the whirlpool. 
This traverses an area that is even now a lake most of the year, possibly suggesting, if we hold the boundary to 
be unchanged, that the area was flooded c.700.
