Basically there have been a series of periods of deposition which have laid down 
silty piles of material (labelled "1" on the diagram). These have then been cut 
into by the sea to produce the "2" surfaces. Bits of the old surfaces have 
survived, especially where they have been protected by various sea walls. Following 
the erosion in each case the next mass of material was deposited. Work at 
Caldicot Castle<A href="../references/NaylingCaseldine1997Caldicot.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
suggests that unit A fills much of the lower Troggy<SUP><A href="notes/surfaces.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>.

A: "Wentlooge Formation": Between 7.1 and 15m<A href="../references/AllenFulford1987Romano.html" target=bottom>*</A> thick. Dated internally to between the end of the 
last glaciation (~11-18000 years) and later than 2180 years ago (Carbon years: <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dating" target=_new>Info</A>)<A href="../references/Allen1990Severn.html" target=bottom>*</A>. Late-iron age / 
early Roman drainage landward of the wall suggests this date for its construction. 
</P>
<P>
B: "Rumney Formation": 0.8 to 2.2m. The wall appears to be pre-1588/89 <SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../references/Davidson2002Coastal.html" target=bottom>*</A>. Deposition seaward of  
the wall continued after its construction and only thinly covers Roman remains and Roman 
drainage is found between the two walls, possibly suggesting the area was originally 
protected by a Roman wall further out<A href="../references/AllenFulford1987Romano.html" target=bottom>*</A><A href="../references/AllenRae1988Vertical.html" target=bottom>*</A>. The inter-wall area is also an area of Medieval field systems<A href="../references/AllenFulford1987Romano.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
</P>
<P>
C: "Awre Formation": up to 3m. Probably ending in 18th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN> as the surface has drainage from 
this period on it<A href="../references/AllenFulford1987Romano.html" target=bottom>*</A><A href="../references/AllenRae1988Vertical.html" target=bottom>*</A>.

D: "Northwick Formation": modern material building up<A href="../references/AllenFulford1987Romano.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
