<P>
Rough position of early constructions after Dennis Manning's 2004 map from 
Nettleship<A href="../references/Nettleship2006Whirly2.html" target=bottom>*</A>. In order of date:
A:	Crick round barrow (2000<SPAN class=smallcaps>BCE</SPAN>);
B:	Ditches and cursus (2000<SPAN class=smallcaps>BCE</SPAN>?) 
plus the Berries motte and bailey (1100<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>); 
C: 	Sudbrook Promonotory Fort (600<SPAN class=smallcaps>BCE</SPAN>);
D:	Caerwent Roman town and road (100<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>);
E:	Harold’s hunting lodge (1065<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>);
F:	Caldicot castle (1100<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>) and Bronze age settlement<A href="../references/Rippon1996Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A>;
G:	Crick Manor House or bailey behind it (1200<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>). The only difference with the map by 
Manning is that he uses the 30ft (9.1m) contour as the reference outline, and here we use the 
rough alluvium location<SUP><A href="notes/destroyed.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>.
