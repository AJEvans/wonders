The area of the Troggy Brook has a complex subsurface hydrology, and  
the surface streams have undergone two periods of radical alteration. 
These factors make it somewhat difficult to assess the form the hydrology 
would have taken in the 'Dark Ages'. Here we'll look at 
where a lake in the Troggy area might have gone, and a 
possible mechanism behind the wonder: syphoning springs (the following is indebted to 
information from, and conversations with, John Nettleship and members of the <SPAN class=smallcaps>CHT</SPAN>).

First, let's look at the evidence there was a lake/inlet there at all. 
The geological map of the area<A href="../references/IGS1981Cheptsow.html" target=bottom>*</A> shows the extent of the 
estuarine alluvium (mud from the Severn) 
(<A href="alluvium.html" target=right>Map</A>). This reaches all the 
way back passed the Roman road north-west of 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=349000.221355482&Y=190000.131748234&width=500&height=300&gride=346681.221355482&gridn=190556.131748234&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&left.x=3&left.y=169" target=_new class=place>Caerwent</A> (probably the Roman 
<I>Venta Silurum</I>: <A href="http://www.roman-britain.org/places/venta_silurum.htm" target=_new>Info</A>) 
(See <A href="troggy.html" target=right>Visit&nbsp;Details</A>: 
<A href="photos/caerwent.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>). 
No work appears to have been done on the age of this alluvium at Caerwent, however, 
there are a few pointers to it being laid down in the last two 
millenia. First, the Roman fort of Caerwent has 
features indicating there was boat access to it<SUP><A href="notes/harbour.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>, 
secondly early building seems to have avoided the area 
(<A href="buildings.html" target=right>Map</A>)<SUP><A href="notes/destroyed.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>, and lastly, work on the alluvium downstream of Caerwent at 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=350000&Y=189000&width=500&height=300&gride=348417.415375845&gridn=188324.696592512&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&downleft.x=2&downleft.y=325" target=_new class=place>Caldicot Castle</A>  
suggests that the area was a broad, tidally influenced, area of water in the 
Iron Age<SUP><A href="notes/caldicotcastle.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP>.

Although there are no OS point heights in the valley, the Troggy sits well below 
the 10m contour all the way to just upstream of Caerwent (a rough estimate for the lower Whirly Pool 
would be 5 to 7m&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>OD</SPAN>). As the tidal range at nearby 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=355000.55789123&Y=195000.244290913&width=500&height=300&gride=353347.55789123&gridn=194038.244290913&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=&zm=0&scale=100000&down.x=260&down.y=325" target=_new class=place>Chepstow bridge</A> is 
50 feet<A href="../references/Walker1888Severn.html" target=bottom>*</A> (15.24m), suggesting 
a rise of some 7.62m above the average sea level, there is a strong possibility that the current tidal limit would 
fall around the lower site in the absence of sea walls.  


The lower half of the area still floods today where it is allowed to<SUP><A href="notes/marsh.html" target=bottom>4</A></SUP>. However it 
doesn't appear to be tidal and certainly wouldn't qualify as an inlet of the Severn (See 
<A href="troggy.html">Visit Details</A>). Given this, one has to ask why 
the inlet, like so many "pills" (inlets) along the Severn, has largely filled in. It is not 
as simple as suggesting the sea has been blocked by walls, as the land height and 
tidal range has changed over recent millennia.
