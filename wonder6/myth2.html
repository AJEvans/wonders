As can be seen, the pig makes, broadly, the reverse trip to the <I>Twrch Trwyth</I>, possibly firming up the identification of the Wonder site 
with the mouth of the Troggy. Like the  <I>Twrch</I> tale this tale is designed to explain the names of places 
along the route, and Bromwich suggests it includes the <I>Tarogi</I> because the sow was <I>Torrawc</I><A href="../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> ("pregnant"<A href="../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>, from <I>tor</I>: "belly").

Although they don't really relate to our wonder, you might also like

Severn and which give an idea of the kind of area it was near the time the Wonder list was being written:
