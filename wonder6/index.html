"There is another wonder: it is the confluence of Linn Liuan; the mouth of that 
river flows into the Severn, and when both the Severn is flooded to The Teared 
[the bore], and the sea is flooded similarly into the aforementioned mouth of 
the river, both it is received into the lake/pool of the mouth in the mode 
of a whirlpool and the sea does not advance 
up. And a bank/shore exists near the river, and so long as the 
Severn is flooded to The Teared [the bore] that bank/shore is 
not covered, and when the sea and Severn ebbs, at that time lake 
Liuan vomits all that it has devoured from the sea and both that 
bank/shore is covered and in the likeness of a mountain in one 
wave it spews and bursts. And if there was the army of the whole 
region, in the midst of where it is, and it directed its face 
against the wave, even the army the wave carries off through 
the force, by fluid full clothes. If, on the other hand, the 
backs of the army were turned against it, the same wave doesn’t 
harm, and when the sea may have ebbed, then the entire bank, 
which the wave covers, backwards is bared and the sea recedes from it.”"

This confusing account apparently describes an  
inlet<SUP><A href="notes/names.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP> on the Severn which swallows the 
tide as it rises, possibly in a whirlpool, only to disgorge the water in a giant wave as the tide retreats<SUP><A href="notes/odd.html" target=bottom>4</A></SUP>. Linn Liuan is probably a variant of the Welsh "Llyn [Lake] Lliwan"<SUP><A href="notes/liuan.html" target=bottom>5</A></SUP> talked of in other works. However, this doesn't help us much, as, despite being 
mentioned over many years<SUP><A href="notes/variants.html" target=bottom>6</A></SUP>, no one now knows where this 
is either! One work 
that features it is a Welsh story "Culhwch and Olwen", which gives it as near the <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=325000.226465842&Y=200000.213026418&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=500000&right.x=5&right.y=18" target=_new class=place>Wye</A> and downstream 
of <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=385000.194149784&Y=220000.764074088&width=500&height=300&gride=383240.194149784&gridn=218607.764074088&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=1&scale=500000" target=_new class=place>Gloucester</A> (see <A href="myth.html">Myth</A>). 

While there have been many suggestions as to where the lake 
was<SUP><A href="notes/others.html" target=bottom>7</A></SUP>, a very likely spot 
has been identified from the description above by John Nettleship and the 
<A href="http://www.caerwentcom.com/trustintro.htm" target=_new>Caerwent Historic Trust</A> (<SPAN class=smallcaps>CHT</SPAN>) as the 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=345000.221340003&Y=190000.131734998&width=500&height=300&gride=346681.221340003&gridn=190556.131734998&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&right.x=514&right.y=166" target=_new class=place>Nedern and Troggy Brook</A><SUP><A href="notes/nedern.html" target=bottom>8</A></SUP>, 
which was once a much larger inlet and until recently had two whirlpools on 
it<SUP><A href="notes/troggy.html" target=bottom>9</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/llion.html" target=bottom>10</A></SUP>.  
In addition, there was an alternative whirlpool near 
Southbrook Farm at  
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=350000&Y=188000&width=700&height=400&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=&zm=0&out.x=4&out.y=5&scale=10000" target=_new class=place>Sudbrook</A>, 
also near the Troggy<SUP><A href="notes/sudbrook.html" target=bottom>11</A></SUP>.
