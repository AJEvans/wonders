The area is shown as "liable to flood" on the second 
revision of the Ordnance Survey 1:10560 maps (c.1900-1949) and drainage channels across the area are 
shown from the earliest OS maps onwards (c.1849-1899). 
John Nettleship<A href="../../references/Nettleship2006Whirly2.html" target=bottom>*</A> notes 
that the area has been flooded <Q>for well over half the year most years since at least 1950</Q>, and that the 
water level in the winter of 2004 was ~12 feet (3.65m) above the levels shown in these photos:

He also notes that a friend, who worked on the piles for the M48 elevation, said the 
ground was deep water-lain muds, which stank, suggesting a considerable buildup of material 
in the area<A href="../../references/Nettleship2006Perscomm.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
