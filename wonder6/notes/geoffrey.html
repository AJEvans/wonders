This is found in Geoffrey of Monmouth's <I>Historia Regum Brittaniae</I> 
(History of the Kings of Britain. See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>). 
Geoffrey uses Arthur's battle at Loch Lomond as an excuse to bring in 
three watery Wonders from Nennius 
(<A href="../../wonder1/index.html" target=right>Lake Lumonoy</A>, 
<A href="../../wonder7/index.html" target=right>Fount Guur Helic</A>, and 
<A href="../../wonder6/index.html" target=right>Linn Liuan</A>). He includes 
information not in the versions of the "Nennius" <I>Historia</I> that we have (at least those 
published), and it seems likely that he had a different manuscript. 
You can read the relevant sections of the <I>Historia Regum Brittaniae</I> 
<A href="http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/geofhkb.htm" target=_new>here</A>. 
The fact that there are three of these may suggest a traditional 
Welsh triad (see, for other examples, Bromwich<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html">*</A>) on 
"the three marvellous lakes", though this is not apparent in the "Nennius" <I>Historia</I>.
