<P>
The name "Nedern" is largely used for the lower reaches of the 
stream, while the upper reaches are known as the "Cas Troggy Brook". 
It's not clear when or why the river became known as the Nedern. 
"Dern" [<I>Dyrne</I>] is Anglo-Saxon for "Secret", though 
Anglo-Saxon terms starting <I>ne&aacute;dun-</I> tend to relate to 
"force" or "violence"<A href="../../references/NorthcoteTollerAngloSaxon.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
Although it is not entirely certain that  
"Cas" has this meaning here, the current Welsh meaning is  
"hateful" or "unpleasant". None of these adjectives could 
really be applied to the current stream, which is a peaceful 
beck, but they may point to a darker past. In the earliest 
definite reference c.895&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../../references/Davies1979Charters.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
it is simply known as the <I>Taroci</I>
(Book of Llan D&#226;v : See 
<A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>).
