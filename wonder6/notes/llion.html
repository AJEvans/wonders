As an interesting aside, this wonder appears to have been built up in the 
largely unverifiable <I>Barddas</I> of Iolo Morganwg (<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iolo_Morganwg" target=_new>Info</A>) into 
a Welsh "Great Flood" myth which has taken on a life of its own. Morganwg 
gives the following in his Triads:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The three burstings of the Lake of Llion: the first, when the world and all living beings were drowned, except Dwyvan and Dwyvach, their children, and grand-children, from whom the world was again peopled--and it was from that bursting that seas were formed; the second was, when the sea went amidst the lands, without either wind or tide; the third was, when the earth burst asunder by means of the powerful agitation, so that the water spouted forth even to the vault of the sky, and all of the nation of the Cymry were drowned, except seventy persons, and the Isle of Britain was parted from Ireland, and from the land of Gaul and Armorica.

<P>
With the footnote:

"Llion" means an aggregate of floods. The bursting of the Lake of Llion is thus chronicled in the Triads:--"The three awful events of the Isle of Britain: first, the bursting of the Lake of Llion, and the overwhelming of the face of all lands; so that all mankind were drowned, excepting Dwyvan and Dwyvach, who escaped in a naked vessel, and of them the island of Britain was re-peopled." (13, Third Series.) In another Triad (97) it is stated that "the ship of Nevydd Nav Neivion carried a male and female of all living beings, when the Lake of Llion burst."
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
It is alluded to by Iorwerth Vynglwyd;--
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<I>Lle ’r gwin mal lloer ar gynnydd,<BR>
Llawn byth fal llyn llion bydd.
</I>
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
The store for wine, like the moon on the increase,<BR>
Ever full, like the Lake of Llion, will it be.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
In the British Chronicles Arthur is introduced, as saying thus;--"There is a lake near the Severn, called the Lake of Llion, which swallows all the water that flows into it at the tide of flood, without any visible increase; but at the tide of ebb, it swells up like a mountain, and pours its waters over its banks, so that whoever stands near it at this time, must run the risk of being overwhelmed."--Myv. Arch. v. ii. p. 311

None of this seems tracable to before the late 1700s, with the exception of the suggested Chronicle excerpt which contains the name 
(though traces may be found in a triad, given below). Even with the "Chronicle" reference, while it is possible one of the "British Chronicles" 
(<I>Brut</I>s: largely adapted from Geoffrey of Monmouth: See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>) does have the lake 
name as <I>Llion</I>, it isn't especially obvious that this is the case - references in the Bruts include:

<I>Brut Y Brenhinedd</I> : <I>Llynn Llywan</I> (Llanstephan 1)<A href="../../references/Roberts1971Brenhinedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> and 
<I>Llynn Lliwan</I>/<I>Llynn Lliwau</I> (Basingwerk/Cotton Cleopatra)<A href="../../references/Parry1937Brenhinedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
The quoted <I>Y Myvyrian Archaiology</I> is a work which contains a number of forgeries and which Iolo had a hand in constructing 
(See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>). The reference seems incorrect; from 
elsewhere within <I>Y Myvyrian Archaiology</I> we have <I>Brut G.Ab Arthur</I> : <I>Llyn Llivan</I>, and 
Brut Tysilio : <I>Llyn Llia6n</I> ["<I>Llyn Lliawn</I>"], but no apparent <I>Llion</I>. 
</P>
<P>
In manuscripts, Iolo variously translated <I>Llion</I> as "Inundations", "Floods" and "Torrents"<A href="../../references/Bromwich1968Third.html">*</A>, 
though this appears to be the only example of this word<A href="../../references/Bromwich1968Third.html">*</A>. While the Welsh for 
floods is <I>Llifogydd</I>, some credence might be given to the general idea that "Flood" lies behind the lake's name in that the 
singular term is <I>Lli</I> or <I>Llif</I> (pronounced "Lthiv"?).
</P>
<P>
However, here the name <I>Llion</I> here appears to be an interesting attempt to 
tie the bursting of the wonder-lake to the Romance notion of the land of Lyonesse, the mythological land flooded off Cornwall 
(See, for example, Camden<a href="../../references/Camden1607Britannia.html" target="bottom">*</a>: 
<a href="http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/cornwalleng.html#cornwall7" target="_new">Cornwall</a>)

which is traditionally the home of Tristan (<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan" target=_new>Info</A>), though works 
equally well in suggesting the lake is near <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=333000&Y=191000&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=&zm=0&scale=25000&right.x=512&right.y=177" target=_new>Caer Llion</A>, on the Usk. 
</P>
<P>
Caer Llion, the Roman <I>Isca Silurum</I> (<A href="http://www.roman-britain.org/places/isca_silurum.htm" target=_new>Info</A>), 
however, is listed in the cities list of the British versions of the <I>Historia</I> as <I>Cair Legeion</I>/<I>Ligion</I>/<I>Legion</I> on the Usk, 
and only becomes <I>Lonin</I>/<I>Leonin</I>/<I>Leonan</I> in the Irish 
versions<A href="../../references/Mommsen1894Historia.html" target=bottom>*</A>, suggesting the current form of the 
name was not that used in the Dark Ages. <I>Cair Legion</I> matches Gildas, and the 
probably derivative Bede  
(See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>), who have <I>Legionum urbis</I>. It is therefore 
far from clear that the move from <I>Liuan</I> to <I>Llion</I> is justified from this point of view, though it does raise 
interesting possibilities.
</P>
<P>
Bromwich suggests that the <I>Loenois</I> or <I>Loonois</I> found in the early Tristan legends is actually Lothian, in Scotland, matching 
a number of Pictish features in  the Tristan story<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(for more, see Jones' <A href="http://www.maryjones.us/jce/lyonesse.html" target=_new>Summary</A>). Exactly when the 
flooding of land off Cornwall was linked to the home of Tristan is not clear 

(Hunt<A href="../../references/Hunt1903Popular.html" target=bottom>*</A> summarises the main sources for the legend: 
<A href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/prwe/prwe085.htm" target=_new>online</A>), though the "Drystan" poem of the 
Black Book of Carmarthen (<A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>) might 
imply an early link (<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/bbc34b.html" target=_new>English Translation</A>). 




 Interestingly 
the name <I>Cyhelig</I> in the poem may point at an alternative innundation story, that of Helig's land, usually regarded as 
being somewhere between the eastern tip of Anglesea 
(<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-4.01890&GridN=53.32030&lon=-4.01890&lat=53.32030&search_result=Puffin%20Island%2C%20Sea&db=freegaz&place=Puffin%20Island%2C%20Sea&pc=&client=public&addr2=&quicksearch=Puffin%20Island&addr3=&scale=100000&addr1=" target=_new class=place>Ynys&nbsp;Seiriol</A>) and 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-3.83250&GridN=53.28660&lon=-3.83250&lat=53.28660&place=Conwy%2C%20Conwy-Other%20Town&db=freegaz&scale=100000&search_result=Conwy%2C%20Conwy-Other%20Town&lang=&db=freegaz&keepicon=true" target=_new class=place>Conway</A> (though 
see earliest example in the triad below). 
This is summarized by, for example, Rhys<A href="../../references/Rhys1901Celtic.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(<A href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/cfwm/cf201.htm" target=_new>online</A>), and was apparently 
known since the 13th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN>, when it was captured in Latin in the Exeter <I>Chronica de Wallia</I><A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>. Bromwich (<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>p.lxxv) gives the triad in translation as:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These are the kingdoms which the sea destroyed: The kingdom of Teithi Hen, son of Gwynnan. king of Kaerrihog. That kingdom was called at the time 'Ynys Teithi Hen'; it was between St David's and Ireland. No one escaped from it, neither men nor animals, except Teithi Hen alone with his horse; afterwards for all the days of his life he was weak from fear.<BR>
The second kingdom was that of Helig son of Glannog, it was between Ceredigion and Bardsey, and as far as St David's. That land was very good, fertile and level, and it was called Maes Maichgen; it lay from the mouth (of the Ystwyth?) to Ll&#0375;n, and upwards to Aberdovey.<BR>
The sea destroyed a third kingdom: the kingdom of Rhedfoe son of Rheged.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Something like this has obviously played a part in generating Iolo's "Three Burstings", though <I>Gwynnan</I> has been conflated with 
the Welsh for water, <I>d&#0373;r</I> to give the Noah-esque <I>Dwyvan</I> (note that Bromwich<A href="../../references/Bromwich1968Third.html">*</A>. alternatively suggests 
<I>Dwy</I> "Goddess", giving "little" and "Great Goddess", while Iolo himself 
translates these as "Man of God" and "Woman of God", or "Daughter of God"<A href="../../references/Bromwich1968Third.html">*</A>). 

An additional hint at this 
particular innundation can be found in the Black Book of Carmarthen poem on <I>Seithenhin</I> 
(<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/bbc38.html" target=_new>English Translation</A>), in which  the 
land of Gwydneu [Gwythno] is apparently innundated. Tradition holds this to be the "Bottom Cantref" of 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=250000.638581181&Y=300000.224663858&width=500&height=300&gride=227993.638581181&gridn=297075.224663858&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=1&scale=1000000" target=_new class=place>Cardigan&nbsp;Bay</A> - matching the Triad above. Bromwich<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> also notes a reference in the 
genealogy of the saints known as the <I>Bonedd y Saint</I> to five saints who were "sons of king <I>Seithennin</I> of <I>maes Gwydno</I> who's 
land the sea conquered". 
The Cardigan Bay land is also referred to in the Mabinogion tale "Branwen"<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>. You can read an English translation <A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/branwen.html" target=_new>here</A>,

This tradition of this being Gwydneu's land may also be backed up by a number of placenames<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>, 
though the ultimate origin of Gwydneu appears to be in Northern Britain according to the genealogies<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>)
A fuller exposition on the Gwythno flood, and its possible relationship to the Helig flood can be found in Bromwich<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> under "G6ythno".
