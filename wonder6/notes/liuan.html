<P>
Bromwich and Evans' suggest <I>Operlinnliuan</I> is synonymous with 
the <I>Llynn Lliwan</I> mentioned in "Culhwch and Olwen" 
[<A href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target=bottom>*</A>line/note:1179]), and, 
indeed, it appears to be an Old Welsh spelling of it 
(See <A href="../../history/welshForms.html" target=right>Welsh Forms</A>). 
</P>
<P>
They also suggest another form found is <I>Llynn Llyw</I> [note for line 891]. This they hold as 
derived from <I>lliw</I> "colour, hue, tint", or as an adjective 
"bright, shining". However, elsewhere [note for line 255] they suggest that 
<I>lliant</I>, meaning "flood, current, sea", may have been used to name 
a character associated with the Severn bore and this would seem 
more pertinent to the lake name as well - note the modern Welsh 
<I>Lli</I> or <I>Llif</I> (pronounced "Lthiv"?) for "flood".
</P>
<P>
It should, however, be noted that 
there is a <I>Ffynnon L(l)uan</I> and ruined Chapel <I>Llanlluan</I> just 
outside <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=255000.35032905&Y=220000.151631897&width=500&height=300&gride=255646.35032905&gridn=218167.151631897&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=1&scale=200000" target=new class=place>Penrhiwgoch</A>, north of 
Swansea<A href="../../references/Jones1954Wells.html">*</A><A href="../../references/Thomas2004Sacred.html">*</A>. While locals know this ruin as 
"Chapel of the Owls"<A href="../../references/Thomas2004Sacred.html">*</A>, 
apparently believing the name derives from <I>tylluan</I> ("owl": plural <I>tylluanod</I>), 
Thomas<A href="../../references/Thomas2004Sacred.html">*</A> 
suggests it probably reflects a, now forgotten, Saint Lluan who could plausibly have given their 
name to the inlet as well. This is not to say the 
saint wasn't named from one of the terms above. 
</P>
<P>
There is actually a minor celtic saint, <I>Llonio</I>, who may be connected with drowning. Henken gives the 
following translation of a confused verse about him<A href="../../references/Henken1987Traditions.html" target=bottom>*</A>...
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
They were trying to prohibit Llonio from a mansion through hatred, something which they could not do. The 
man would drown, the way was wicked, as I know, enemy of Maelgwn formerly.

<P>
...though it seems a pretty big stretch to leap from this the name <I>Liuan</I>. 
An alternative is that the name of <I>Llanlluan</I> is somehow 
related to the name of the nearby Roman <A href="http://www.roman-britain.org/places/leucarum.htm" target=_new>Leucarum</A>. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, the estuaries of 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=225000.35032905&Y=225000.151631897&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=500000&down.x=191&down.y=7" target=_new class=place>Carmarthen Bay</A>, which is near Llanlluan, might provide an alternative searching ground for this wonder: either it may be possible that the lake name is related to the name of the major inlet of 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/places.cgi?client=public&lang=&advanced=&keepicon=true&quicksearch=Loughor" target=_new class=place>Loughor/<I>Llwchwr</I></A>, and in turn this may be related to <I>Leucarum</I> 
as well<A href="../../references/Lewis1849Topographic.html" target=bottom>*</A>, 
or the lack of other chapels with the name <I>Llanlluan</I> might suggest a very localized cult for the hypothetical Saint Lluan in 
the Carmarthen Bay area (though Celtic saints aren't generally the stay-at-home type, and there's no other reason for supposing they should have just stuck round Carmarthen). However, for a Carmarthen location, one would have to argue the unlikely suggestion that <I>Sabrina</I> in the original covered the coast all the way round to Swansea and was, therefore, only loosely coterminous with 
the "Severn", and that the bore wasn't under discussion.
