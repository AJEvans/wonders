NB: Each depositional unit is, plainly, also associated with a surface (e.g. the "Wentlooge Surface" 
is the upper surface of the Wentlooge Formation). The area between the sea walls is known as 
the Oldbury surface<A href="../../references/AllenFulford1987Romano.html" target=bottom>*</A>, the Rumney Surface 
being the area of continued Rumney Formation deposition seaward of the wall. 
<P>
A: "Wentlooge Formation": Up to 15m of blue-green estuarine slty-sandy clays. Lower part has 
ice wedge (<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_wedge" target=_new>Info</A>) traces, suggesting deposition started close to the end of the last glaciation. Upper part has peats with trees indicating 
a period when the sea was retreating in the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age<A href="../../references/AllenFulford1987Romano.html" target=bottom>*</A>. Above this marine 
sediments then continue. This matches the picture at Calidicot Castle in the lower Troggy  
(See <A href="caldicotcastle.html" target=bottom>Note</A>). 
 
The Wentlooge Surface is 1.2m below the Rumney surface<A href="../../references/AllenFulford1987Romano.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
Generally, there has been an increase in the deposition rate 
since this the erosion of the Wentlooge<A href="../../references/AllenRae1988Vertical.html" target=bottom>*</A>.

B: "Rumney Formation": the Rumney surface is at 0.5m above mean spring tides high water<A href="../../references/AllenFulford1987Romano.html" target=bottom>*</A>. In the Oldbury Surface area 
deposition was interupted by the medieval reclaimations so it is ~1m lower than the 
Rumney Surface<A href="../../references/AllenFulford1987Romano.html" target=bottom>*</A>. Generally there 
seems to have been an advance in the sea in the 13th-14th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN> leading to the seawall being moved inland, 
and the loss of habours like Abergwaitha at <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=344000&Y=184000&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=&zm=0&scale=25000&up.x=267&up.y=3" target=_new class=place>Magor Pill</A><A href="../../references/Nayling1998Magor.html" target=bottom>*</A>

area and its relationship to settlement can be found in
