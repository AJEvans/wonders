The only sticking point with the identification of the wonder with the Troggy is the lack of historical evidence 
for the use of the name <I>Linn Liuan</I> for this area. While many features in the 
Gwent area may have kept the same names for at least 1900 years there are many, particularly 
on the oft-abandoned coastal plain, that have lost names we know of from historic 
records (for examples, see Rippon<A href="../../references/Rippon1996Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A>). 
However, what is worrying here is that we have two good boundary descriptions for the Troggy  
area from from the Book of Llan D&#226;v (See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>) which make no mention of it. 
Here's the entries relating to the Troggy. The text of the translations  
and parenthesised names are by

Later records are no more helpful. 
Caldicot appears in the Domesday<A href="../../references/PRO1085Domesday.html" target=bottom>*</A> and Hereford Domesday<A href="../../references/Rippon1996Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A> under Gloucester, but both have very scant records for the area.

Following silting of Caldicot Pill 
the River Troggy developed. Formerly it ran to the east of its current position
(<A href="caldicot.html" target=right>Map</A>). Manorial bounds from 1613 give the 
old course as Deepweir, Chark Brook, William Lewis' Mead, Vallis Mead, Dinham's Meadow, Bisditch, 
the patches of mead made by Portskewett's Ford called Base Half Acre and Alder/Toder-fordes Acre, 
Sudbrook Mill, Sudbrook Pill, the Severn<A href="../../references/Rippon1996Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A>. So, again, no mention there.
</P>

Portskewett (from "The Port in Gwent IsCoed" - i.e. below the [Went]Wood) is 
mentioned in the Welsh triads (See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>) 
within the "Names of the Island of Britain" as <I>Porth Ys(g)ewin y Gwent</I><A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html">*</a>, noting it as one of 
the three chief ports of Britain. It is mentioned in poetry which may 
be as old as the 7th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN> (in <I><A href="http://www.celtic-twilight.com/camelot/poetry/yrhengerdd/moliant_cadwallon.htm" target=_new>Moliant Cadwallon</A></I>, c.633&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>, as an example of a place far from 
Gwynedd<A href="../../references/KochCarey2003Celtic.html" target=bottom>*</A>; Rippon<A href="../../references/Rippon1996Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
also notes it in a similarly aged but not-identified poem as "beautiful <I>Porth Esgewin</I>") and 
it may be the port near Caerwent at which St.Tatheus 
landed at some point in the 'Dark Ages' 
(<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/tatheus.html" target=_new>Life</A>)<A href="../../references/Rippon1996Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
The location of the port is likely to have been at the mouth of the Troggy near 
the current village (<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=349000.221355482&Y=189000.131748234&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=&zm=0&scale=25000&down.x=259&down.y=325"

Beneath these places upon the Severn Sea, nere unto Wy-mouth, standeth Portskeweth, which Marianus nameth Portscith; who hath recorded that Harald in the yeere 1065 erected a fort there against the Welshmen, which they streightwaies under the conduct of Caradock overthrew. And adjoining to it is Sudbrok the church wherof called Trinity Chappell standeth so neere the sea that the vicinity of so tyrannous a neighbour hath spoiled it of halfe the Church-yarde...

The church was built in the moat of the Roman(?) fort<A href="../../references/Walker1888Severn.html" target=bottom>*</A>, and, while now ruined, is still on the coast. The remains 
are marked on the modern OS <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=350000&Y=187500&width=500&height=300&gride=347865.520054708&gridn=188552.810309675&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=&zm=0&scale=50000&multimap.x=270&multimap.y=160" target=_new class=place>map</A>.

Generally, the presence of the port in sources suggests silting had already driven 
navigability of the pill down to the coast by the time they were written. Conversely, therefore, the absence of the name of 
Portskewett from the wonder description, while unfortunate, is not unreasonable. 
Note also that the boundary description above just gives 
the pill's name as <I>Aper Taroci</I> ["Mouth of the Troggy"]. This name ["Aber Tarogi"] also appears in the Triad "The Three Powerful Swineherds of the 
Island of Britain" in a number of manuscripts including the oldest 
[Peniarth 16; possibly based on a text c.1200<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>], 
but strangely not in the <I>Llyfr Gwyn Rhydderch</I> 
["White book of Rhydderch"] written c.1325<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>, possibly suggesting the name had been forgotten by then.

Bisditch (Biestediche, 13th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN>; Bisditch,17th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN>; Bees Ditch, 19th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN><A href="../../references/Sylvester1958Common.html" target=bottom>*</A>) is first mentioned as a pasture in the late 13th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN><A href="../../references/Rippon1996Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A>, so 
some reclaimation must have occurred by then. The area to the west of the present pill known as the Common Sea was first mentioned with this name in 1613<A href="../../references/Rippon1996Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A>, though the degree of reclaimation at this time 
is not entirely certain. 
</P>
<P>
The new course of the Troggy could have been at least 
partly flowing at pretty much 
any time as mills that it may have fed have been mentioned from the Domesday (1086&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>) onwards<A href="../../references/Rippon1996Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A>. The area immediately north of Caldicot Pill between 
Deepweir and the Common Sea was just described as a millpond in a sale document of 1734<A href="../../references/Rippon1996Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A> (a mill is located 
at the head of Caldicot Pill by a survey of 1613<A href="../../references/Rippon1996Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A>). 
It is not clear when the Troggy picked up the name by which it is now generally known - the Nedern.
</P>
<P>
In short then, historical records other than the <I>Historia</I> are of no great help proving the Troggy was 
the location. In addition, if <I>Sissam</I> in the description refers to the bore 
(See <A href="translation.html" target=bottom>Note</A>), we may have to accept that the bore must have started 
further downstream in the Severn at the time of the wonder than it does now, as currently it starts <I>forming</I> around the Caldicot area, and 
would be unlikely to enter the Pill.
