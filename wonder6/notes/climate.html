The work at Caldicot Castle and elsewhere suggests the innundation of 
the sea in the Severn, and indeed across the south of Britain, was 
in part due to sedimentation changes at the coast dependent on 
climate 
change<A href="../../references/NaylingCaseldine1997Caldicot.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
Long term climate change in the North Atlantic follows 
a broadly 1500 year cycle<A href="../../references/Bianchi1999Holocene.html">*</A>. 
However, actual temperature proxies show that the picture 
is more complex. Temperature records 
extracted from cave features growing over the period in 
Ireland show a broad cooling from 
~5400 to 1500<SPAN class=smallcaps>BCE</SPAN>, then rising temperatures 
to 600<SPAN class=smallcaps>BCE</SPAN> 
which begin to fall into the Dark Ages Cold Period 
(<A href="../../wonder9/notes/DACP.html">Note</A>) after 
0<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../../references/McDermott2001Centennial.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
To a degree, this matches the picture in terms of tidal influence 
at Caldicot Castle (<A href="caldicotcastle.html" target=bottom>Note</A>). 
While higher temperatures in the North Atlantic therefore seem to 
match with a higher tidal influence in the Severn, suggesting tidal conditions 
lasted through the Roman period and fell into the Dark Ages, the relationship 
between climate, landuse and sedimentation is certainly not this clear cut.
