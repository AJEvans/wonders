<P>
From <I>Brut Gruffudd ab Arthur</I> (see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>), quoted by Guest<A href="../../references/Guest1877Mabinogion.html">*</A> (she quotes 
it from the dubious <I>Y Myvyrian Archaiology</I> [see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>], but this seems sound). The version in Geoffrey is very similar, but the <I>Brut</I> is 
quoted here as the translation gives a clearer place to the properties of 
the water.
