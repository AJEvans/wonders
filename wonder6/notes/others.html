Bromwich and Evans<A href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
suggest that this wonder is describing <Q>where the Severn 
estuary is tidal and the river meets it in spate [causing] a whirlpool and a very 
great noise</Q>. They note that the description may be of flooding on 
the English side of the Severn in Gloucestershire, noting Camden's<A href="../../references/Camden1607Britannia.html">*</A> 
<A href="http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/gloceng.html#gloc1" target=new>description</A> 
(he actually claims to quote William of Malmesbury's <I>De gestis pontificum Anglorum</I> of 1125&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN> 
[<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Malmesbury" target=_new>biography</A>]) 
of the bore wandering onto the plains of Gloucestershire. 

However, they take the evidence of <I>Culhwch ac Olwen</I> to suggest the 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=330000&Y=180000&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=200000&multimap.x=283&multimap.y=85" target=_new class=place>mouth</A> of the River Usk (<A href="../usk.html" class=photo target=right>Photo</A>). The first evidence is a story about a giant Salmon, which may 
represent the bore, who lives 
at the (possibly) synonymous <I>Llynn Llyw</I> [<A href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target=bottom>*</A>line 891] that he travels with the 
tide upstream to Gloucester. The second is that the giant boar, <I>Twrch Trwyth</I>, 
the chasing of which is a major part of <I>Culhwch ac Olwen</I>, runs 
between <I>Ystrat Yw</I> (<I>Ystrad Yw</I>: area around

The only factor working against this is 
that the Usk (<I>Wysg</I>) has an old and well known name (see Williams<A href="../../references/Williams1990Wysg.html">*</A>; 
<I>Isca</I>, Ravenna Cosmography, 7th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN>, but also the town of <I>Iscae</I> in the 
Antonine Itinerary of 2nd&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN>, see 
<A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>) and it seems strange this wasn't used in <I>Culhwch</I> explicitly if that area was meant.

However, other alternatives include the 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=318000&Y=173000&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=25000&up.x=194&up.y=5" target=_new class=place>mouth</A> of the River Taff: Marie Trevelyan<A href="../../references/Thomas1909Folklore.html">*</A>, in 1909, reports the following folklore...
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The whirlpool of the River Taff at Cardiff forms a small lake when the bed is almost dry. In the days of old this whirlpool was called one of the "seven wonders of Glamorgan." People said it was fathomless, and in its cavernous depths a monstrous serpent dwelt, and gorged on the unfortunate victims that were drowned in the river and sucked into the whirlpool.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
However, she gives neither source nor location for this. It was possibly 
near the mouth of the Taff, however, given the dock building there 
from 1839-1907, and the Taff diversion in 1853<A href="../../references/SandersFamilyHistory.html">*</A> 
the likelihood of this depends on whether her reference is contemporary or oral history. 
The Taff is not within the current area effected by the Bore, 
making it unlikely if the Bore is being discussed.
</P>
<P>
The 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=350000&Y=190000&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=200000&multimap.x=330&multimap.y=140" target=_new class=place>Wye</A> 
(<A href="../wye.html" class=photo target=right>Photo</A>) also seems possible.  

The mouth of the Wye has a massive advantage in that it is the current location of the 
start of the Bore, and would therefore match with the Salmon of <I>Culhwch ac Olwen</I> 
being a embodiment of the feature and details of 
the <A href="../../severn/science.html" target=right>Bore</A>).
</P>
<P>
Another possible location is <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-2.91980&GridN=51.54390&lon=-2.91980&lat=51.54390&search_result=Goldcliff%2C%20Newport&db=freegaz&place=Goldcliff%2C%20Newport&pc=&client=public&addr2=&quicksearch=Goldcliff&addr3=&scale=100000&addr1=" target=_new>Goldcliff</A>. The light shining on the local rocks 
at sunset makes them glow gold, hence the name<A href="../../references/DeBarri1187Itinerarium.html" target=bottom>*</A> - if we hold with Bromwich's derivation of the 
name from "lake shining" (<A href="liuan.html" target=bottom>Note</A>) we might draw a very thin link. Goldcliff has been a site of notable inhabitation 
since at least the Iron Age<A href="../../references/Davidson2002Coastal.html" target=bottom>*</A>, 
and there are considerable historical records for the area<A href="../../references/Rippon1996Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A>, though none seem to suggest 
the use of the name <I>Llyn Liuan</I>.
</P> 

<P>
Other suggestions include<A href="../../references/Anon2004Gwent.html">*</A> Llymon Brook which runs from 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=345000.852745586&Y=215000.951555298&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=100000&upleft.x=10&upleft.y=9" target=_new>Cross Ash</A> to join the River Trothy. 

This is actually a quite strong candidate, as we know the Trothy joined to the only historically recorded 
feature called <I>Liuan</I> from a boundary 
(c. 970&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../../references/Davies1979Charters.html">*</A>;  
<a href="../../references/Evans1893Llandav.html" target="bottom">*</a>p.241) in the 
Book of Llan D&#226;v (See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>).
The name of the town near the 
mouth of the Llymon, 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=347000&Y=214000&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=&zm=0&scale=25000&left.x=2&left.y=165" target=_new class=place>Llanfihangel Ystern <I>Llewern</I></A>, and the naming of a 
nearby farm (on 1880's maps; 500m east of the river mouth on the B4233) 
as <I>Pant-y-Pwll</I> (Hollow of the Pool) are all suggestive.
</P>
<P>
However, it is hard to be definitive about the Llymon. One of the Latin boundary descriptions in the Book of Llan D&#226;v 
(c.780&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../../references/Davies1979Charters.html">*</A>; for Cair Riov, <a href="../../references/Evans1893Llandav.html" target="bottom">*</a>p.210; ) also 
appears to cover the area, and on the one hand it gives the Llymon's name 
as the latinated <I>Liminan</I>, which seems closer to the modern version, but on the other 
includes the "fount of Baraliuen" and mentions a pool, which seem indicative. Either way 
the mention of the Severn in our wonder description, and the location of the pool as the place where 
the Trwch entered the sea makes it very unlikely to be the location of our wonder.
</P>
<P>
The same argument also applies to Pwll Lifan, also on the Troggy 
(the text of the translations  
and parenthesised names are by Evans<a href="../../references/Evans1893Llandav.html" target="bottom">*</a> p.228; 
dated c.876&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../../references/Davies1979Charters.html">*</A>):

 The location in the Book of Llan D&#226;v of 
the Gueithirin Trodi text with its Tref Pedir so close to the Taroci text with its Tref Peren

wishing the rest of the Trodi text was more ambiguous, but the identification of Gueithirin as Llanvetherin rather than anywhere on 
the Severn seems sound.

Another strong contender must be the parish of <I>Ystrad Hafren</I> ("Vale/Flat of the Severn").

Its boundary is from the wood to the sea and as far as the podium (mansion) of Ceuid, and with all its liberty in field and in woods, in water and in pastures. Its boundary is, from the upper part of the grove Ili to the sea, and from Glasguern (Glasgwern) ["Green (/Blue?) meadow"] to Louern.

However, it is not certain that <I>Ystrad Hafren</I> is Tidenham, let alone the location of the wonder. For example, a further boundary

The boundary is - from Oaper [Aber: "confluence"; "mouth"] Nant ["brook"; "gorge"] 
Bis on the Bis (Evans seems to suggest this should be Bic, in line with the

From the road to the Ardd ["hill"; "height"], along the Ardd towards the west as far as the Cecin

far as Nant foss (ffos ["ditch"]) pluum [plwm? "lead"], along (it) upwards to Istrad Hafren. From the 
top of (Ystrad Hafren) as far as the Cecin, along the Cecin as far as the road, to the Ardd, along the Ardd as far

Given that everyone from Rees<A href="../../references/Rees1840Liber.html" target=bottom>*</A> onwards has identified Llan C&uacute;m as

obviously mentioned in the description. Indeed, "Flat of the Severn" would better describe the Gwent Levels than Tidenwell, if this is the

rendering it unlikely to relate to

Pughe<A href="../../references/Pughe1873Dictionary.html" target=bottom>*</A> has under “Llion”: 
"<I>Llyn Llion – a small pool at Chepstow which ebbs and flows contrary to the tides.</I>” 
Sadly, all of Pughe’s details for “Llyn Llion” seems to derive from the unreliable Iolo Morganwg 
(see <A href="llion.html" target=bottom>note</A>) and there are apparently no other 
records of the pool being at this location. 
Bradney<A href="../../references/Bradney1929History.html" target=bottom>*</A>, who finds three of the Wonders 
near Chepstow, doesn't mention it (the nearest being the place <i>livurnell</i>, 1683<A href="../../references/Bradney1929History.html" target=bottom>*</A>). 
It is possible that Pughe’s source was thinking of the 
ebb-and-flow well at “Woodfield” (a house near Chepstow bridge)<A href="../../references/Bradney1929History.html" target=bottom>*</A> - 
however, although this did act in opposition to the tide, it is hard to imagine it inspiring the violent description of the wonder.

Finally, the Severn Estuary has changed significantly over the period since the 
'Dark Age'<A href="../../references/Anon2002Estuary.html">*</A>, with some 111.20km<SUP>2</SUP> 
of land reclaimed on the Gwent Levels<A href="../../references/Davidson2002Coastal.html" target=bottom>*</A> (between Cardiff and Caldicot). Most of the Gwent Levels are below the current maximum 
tide at 4.5 to 6.1m (mean spring tide high water 6.2-6.4m <SPAN class=smallcaps>OD</SPAN>, though 
frequently as high as 7.3m), 
and would be flooded if not for the sea 
defenses<A href="../../references/Rippon1996Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A>. However, there 
has also been considerable silting - for example, Magor Pill [possibly once called 
<I>Abergwaitha</I><A href="../../references/Davidson2002Coastal.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
"Mouth of the Works"<A href="../../references/Rippon1996Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A>], Collister Pill
