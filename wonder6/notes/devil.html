Of course, the devil is very much in the details. The situation at Caerwent is reasonably good 
for a syphon system: the underlying geology of the "Caerwent Basin" is made up 
of bands of porous sandstone and limestone with caves. The Troggy cuts 
into the surrounding high land providing the necessary relief, and we know there was 
resurgent water leaving the system at the Whirly Pools. It is also plain, however, that the limestone 
has a number of exits: local Colin Titcombe mapped a number that were 
open in the 1950s to 1970s<A href="../../references/Nettleship2006Perscomm.html" 
target=bottom>*</A> despite the capping in the 1800s. This may be suggestive of a very large series of cavities that 
could swallow a tide, but might be less conducive to a syphon system which relies on 
a reasonably air-tight syphon section. Detailed consideration of the tidal 
inflow, removal rates, resurgent-water tracing speeds, tunnel widths, 
and possible chamber sizes would be necessary to 
determine whether the hypothesis is likely.
