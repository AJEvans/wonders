The evidence is outlined in Nayling and 
Caseldine<A href="../../references/NaylingCaseldine1997Caldicot.html" target=bottom>*</A>. Essentially 
they find that the broad marine area that existed in the Mesolithic moved to freshwater channels 
in the Neolithic and early Bronze Age (~4000<SPAN class=smallcaps>BCE</SPAN> onwards), before the channels broadened once more 
and became tidal in the late Bronze Age (possibly as early as 
1500<SPAN class=smallcaps>BCE</SPAN>, but more definitely by 1000<SPAN class=smallcaps>BCE</SPAN>) 
and early Iron Age (~500<SPAN class=smallcaps>BCE</SPAN>). These changes reflect the 
changing relationships between rising sea level and sediment inputs, which, in turn, 
reflect changes in climate modulated by local agricultural changes<A href="../../references/NaylingCaseldine1997Caldicot.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
