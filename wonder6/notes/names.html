<P>
The <I>Oper</I> of manuscript <A href="../../history/manuscripts.html#A" target=right>A</A> 
(and the <I>Aper</I> of later manuscripts) is likely to be the modern 
<I>Aber</I>. "P" and ""b" are pretty interchangable in Old Welsh (See 
<A href="../../history/welshForms.html" target=right>Welsh forms</a>). 
<I>Aper</I> appears in a land grant by Hywel ap Rhys 
(c.850-c.885) though this is in the later <I>Liber Landavensis</I>  
("The Book of Llan Dâv": 1133-13th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN>?)<A href="../../references/Jones1954Wells.html">*</A>).     
The use of <I>O</I> for <I>A</I> seems more unusual, and the trend was for Brythonic or earlier "a" to become "o", not the reverse<A href="../../references/Strachan1909Early.html" target=bottom>*</A>, possibly suggesting an early intermediate date. 
</P>
<P>
<I>Aber</I> can refer either to the mouth of a river at the coast, or, 
more unusually, a river's confluence with another. For an example of 
the latter, see 
Gerald of Wales<a href="../../references/DeBarri1187Itinerarium.html">*</a> 
(1197 <span class="smallcaps">CE</span>: <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=37305&amp;pageno=19" target="new">Book 1, Chapter II</a>, in the latin).

<I>Linn</I> would appear to be <I>Llyn</I> ("Lake": See 
<A href="../../history/welshForms.html" target=right>Welsh forms</a>). However, 
there is no extant precedent for the use of <I>Llyn</I> to describe a coastal inlet, at least 
on the early nautical charts of Lewis<A href="../../references/Morris1748Charts.html">*</A> (1748&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>) or William<A href="../../references/Morris1801Charts.html">*</A> (1801&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>) Morris. The nearest is on Lewis Morris' <A href="http://www.llgc.org.uk/drych/lem/lem020.htm" target=_new>map</A> of the 
coast of Pembrookshire at <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=207500&Y=240000&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=50000&multimap.x=157&multimap.y=175" target=_new>Newport</A> (Note, not Newport on the Severn), which shows 
a tidal inlet with the farm name <I>Llwyn Gwair</I>. However, this has a perfectly acceptable translation of "Mown/Hay Grove". In defense of its use, however, note that <I>Pwll</I> ["Pool"] was used to describe 
coastal inlets (for more details see <A href="../../wonder11/index.html" target=right>Wonder 11</A>).
