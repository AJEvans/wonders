It should, however, be noted that 
there is a <I>Ffynnon L(l)uan</I> and ruined Chapel <I>Llanlluan</I> just 
outside <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=255000.35032905&Y=220000.151631897&width=500&height=300&gride=255646.35032905&gridn=218167.151631897&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=1&scale=200000" target=new class=place>Penrhiwgoch</A>, north of 
Swansea<A href="../../references/Jones1954Wells.html">*</A><A href="../../references/Thomas2004Sacred.html">*</A>. While locals know this ruin as 
"Chapel of the Owls"<A href="../../references/Thomas2004Sacred.html">*</A>, 
apparently believing the name derives from <I>tylluan</I> ("owl": plural <I>tylluanod</I>), 
Thomas<A href="../../references/Thomas2004Sacred.html">*</A> 
suggests it probably reflects a, now forgotten, Saint Lluan.

<P>
Given these features, it is possible that the <I>Llyn Liuan</I> = <I>Llyn Lliwan</I> equality, 
or the derivation by Bromwich and Evans (see note <A href="6.html">6</A>), are incorrect. 

Either way, it is possible that the estuaries of 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=225000.35032905&Y=225000.151631897&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=500000&down.x=191&down.y=7" target=_new class=place>Carmarthen Bay</A>, which is near Llanlluan, might provide an alternative searching ground for this wonder. The lack of other chapels with this name might boost this suspicion by suggest a very localized cult 
for the hypothetical Saint Lluan, however Celtic saints aren't generally the stay-at-home type, and there's no other reason for supposing they should have just stuck round Carmarthen. Additionally, a Carmarthen location would 
have to argue against the strong suggestion that this was discussing the Bore.
