The lower pool is a more likely candidate for the wonder. It sits in a small triangular hollow off the side of 
the main floodplain, presumably where a tributary stream cut through the glacial sediments to the limestone 
bedrock
(<A href="photos/troggy-lower-pool.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>). 
While the resurgence doesn't appear to be in the place it once was, just a few meters round the corner the main floodplain is nearly permanently 
under water, with a thick covering of marsh plants. A clear area next to the Whirly Pool site may indicate 
resurgent flow (<A href="photos/troggy-lower-flood.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>). 

The Parish boundary ran down the channel that drained the Whirly Pool 
(1775 <a href="sale.html">Map</a>), parallel to the fence in 
the photo, which follows an 1800s(?) drainage channel down to the Troggy. That the boundary kinks here 
may indicate the flooding was there when the boundary was defined, possibly in the Dark Ages 
(See <A href="science2.html" target=right>Science</A>). Certainly 
the land has flooded for some time<SUP><A href="notes/flood.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>. 
You can actually walk down under the 
M48 pilings shown on the photo along a footpath 
(<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=346000&Y=190000&width=500&height=300&gride=348417.415375845&gridn=188324.696592512&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&right.x=512&right.y=172" target=_new class=place>Map</A>), which is a good spot to view the flooded "lake" and the 
location of the lower Whirly Hole 
(<A href="photos/troggy-lower-john1.html" class=photo>Photo</A> looking towards the site; 
<A href="photos/troggy-lower-john2.html" class=photo>Photo</A> looking away from the site). 
By way of interest, the motorway pilings appear to have obliterated an additional 
spring which is marked on older maps as a "Holy Well"

Conveniently, the location does match the wonder description quite nicely, as there is a large 
bank a couple of hundred meters downstream which, if the tide reached the pool, you'd expect to 
get wet (<A href="photos/troggy-lower-bank.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>). Of course, 
once you go looking for such things, it is easy to find them, but the feature is at least distinct 
enough to be known locally as "The Bank".
