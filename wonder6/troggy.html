While it is possible to get to some of the suggested sites for this 
wonder (<A href="usk.html">The Usk</A>; <A href="wye.html">The Wye</A>), the Troggy Whirlpools (or "Whirly Pools" as they 
are known locally) are 
currently on private land (and thanks go to the landowner for access in our attempts to tie down their  
locations). It is, however, possible to see the area from a variety of roads, as the photos below will show. 
Here's a overview <A href="photos/troggy-overview.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A> of the area.  
</P>
<P>The Whirly Pools appear to have alternated between discharging and swallowing water, acting as 
resurgences of water that entered the underlying bedrock further up-valley. This 
seems to have occurred just outside of living memory, infact until alterations during 
the building of the Severn Tunnel when they may have been filled in (See <A href="science.html">Science</A>).
There are two main "Whirly Pools", as can be seen on the 1775 
<A href="sale.html" target=right>Map</A>. Neither now have pools 
(<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=346000&Y=190000&width=500&height=300&gride=348417.415375845&gridn=188324.696592512&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&right.x=512&right.y=172" target=_new class=place>Modern&nbsp;Map</A>), though the lower pool site  
(right on the maps) is on the edge of a area that floods annually, and may still contain 
a resurgence of water. 
</P>
<P>
The area of the whirlpool highest up the stream can be seen from the 
junction near Brockwells Farm marked with a phone on the modern map 
(<A href="photos/troggy-upper-road.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>).  
Within the field it is possible to see the hollow the pool would once have occupied 
(<A href="photos/troggy-upper-pool.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>), and the 
bed of the stream which would once have drained it 
(<A href="photos/troggy-upper-stream.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>). As can be seen from the photos, there is 
a height difference of a couple of metres between the edge of the pool hollow and the 
bottom of the Troggy valley, making it less likely the tide ever reached this pool, even 
if it reached the lower Whirly Pool.
