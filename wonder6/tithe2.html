Caldicott Tithe Map of 1842 – area of Caerwent’s Brook. Supplied by John Nettleship. 
Shows the potential double hole at the western-most Whirly Pool. Also shows the 
strange channel leading across the Whirly Pool Mead field and a potential liver-shaped 
pond near the crossroads. This is now largely infilled.
