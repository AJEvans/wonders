While in the area, it's worth a trek to either end of the Troggy for two very 
different experiences. Just upstream of the Whirly Pools is 
Caerwent (<A href="http://www.roman-britain.org/places/venta_silurum.htm" target=_new class=place>Info</A>;  
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=347000.221355482&Y=191000.131748234&width=500&height=300&gride=346681.221355482&gridn=190556.131748234&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=&zm=0&scale=25000&down.x=258&down.y=325" target=_new class=place>Map</A>), which is 
well worth a visit. The Roman walls of this town are well preserved 

(<A href="photos/caerwent-west.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A> of west wall), 

including the southern wall, known in the 1800's as the "Port Wall".


From the south wall you get a good view across the Troggy valley, and it is 
easy to see the flat section of the valley running up the middle 

(<A href="photos/caerwent-south.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>: flat area between hedgerows) 

 
which is likely to be alluvial infill (though may be associated with the alteration of the brook's course 
when the Severn Tunnel was built:  
see <A href="science3.html" target=right>Science</A>).

At the other extreme, in time and engineering history as much as space, is the 
current mouth of the Troggy at Calicot Pill 
(<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=348000.520054708&Y=188000.810309675&width=500&height=300&gride=347865.520054708&gridn=188552.810309675&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&right.x=513&right.y=163" target=_new class=place>Map</A>; previously it discharged at further east  
<A href="notes/caldicot.html">Map</A><SUP><A href="notes/troggy.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>). 
If you park in the small industrial estate labelled "The Pill" on the map, you 
can walk down the Troggy 

(<A href="photos/caldicot-stream.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>)

to the Severn, where you find yourself under the ominous start of 
the old Severn bridge, undoubtably one of the creepiest places in Britain and, in some strange way, even wonderful 

(<A href="photos/caldicot-nexttobridge.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A> next to the bridge; 
<A href="photos/caldicot-underbridge.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A> under the bridge).
