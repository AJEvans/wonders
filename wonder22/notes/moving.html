Grinsell<A href="../../references/Grinsell1976Folklore.html" target=bottom>*</A> lists 38 other rocks/sets of rocks which are said to 
move, of which 9 rotate and 2 others circle around an area: Tinglestone in Gloucestershire 
(<A href="http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/4705/tinglestone.html" target=_new>Details</A>) runs around a field, and 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/maps/?qs=pentrefelin&countryCode=GB&lon=-4.19340&lat=52.93444&data=os&zoom=13&moveMap=0,0#map=52.93444,-4.1934|15|4&dp=904,830&loc=GB:52.93444:-4.1934:14|pentrefelin|Pentrefelin,%20Criccieth,%20Gwynedd,%20Wales,%20LL52%200" target=_new class=place>Pentre'r&nbsp;Felin</A> stone in 
Gwynedd turns three times around a pool.  Note the "three"; Grinsell also points out the connection between stones and the numbers three and 
nine - on the three(!) occasions the number of movements of the above 38 stones are noted, it is always three movements.
