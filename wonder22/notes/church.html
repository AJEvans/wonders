<P>
This supposition, within Lewis<A href="../../references/Lewis1849Topographic.html" target=bottom>*</A>, 
seems popular, but there doesn't appear to be any great physical evidence for it. The COFLEIN record for the 
church<A href="../../references/COFLEIN2004Tyfrydog.html" target=bottom>*</A>
doesn't suggest any archaeological work has been done there, and, indeed, there is a record 
for a early medievel chapel elsewhere in the 
village<A href="../../references/COFLEIN2008Lidach.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
The only evidence is the name of the church - though this may well be a good pointer: Tyfrydog is not a particularly usual 
Welsh saint, and the naming may indicate a genuine association with this very early 
figure.
