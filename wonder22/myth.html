The stone, which apparently resembles a small man with a sack over his back, is said to 
have once been a man, petrified when he tried to steal books from the church at 
Llandyfrydog<A href="../references/Grinsell1976Folklore.html" target=bottom>*</A>. The rock 
runs around its field three times on Christmas Eve when it hears the church bell strike twelve 
(midnight presumably). 

Tales of petrified wrong-doers are common stock around stones: Grinsell<A href="../references/Grinsell1976Folklore.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
lists 19 others in Britain, of which at least 9 were also  
for standing in the way of christianity or breaking the Sabbath tabu in some way. He suggest that such legends 
date from the 17th century, when the idea of a divine judgement for Sabbath-breaking was a popular theme in church sermons.

This suggests the folklore about the theft is more recent, which might explain why the  
church isn't mentioned in the wonder (if we accept they are the same site). 

The current church is 14th-15th century (<A href="../references/Jones1859Mona.html" target=bottom>*</A>p.174),  
however, the church is named after St. Tyvrydog, and may therefore have been founded as early as the 
5th century<SUP><A href="notes/church.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>. 


Despite this, if the tale of the theft was of any age at all, it would be more likely to mention the 
saint petrifying the thief, matching other thief-petrifications by early saints, like Illtud who 
turned two thieves into stone<SUP><A href="../wonder10/life/petrify.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>. That said, this may have been the original story 
and this element lost over time. Either way, moving stones stand on their own as a folklore 
element, with Grinsell<A href="../references/Grinsell1976Folklore.html" target=bottom>*</A> listing some 
38 other rocks/sets of rocks which are said to move.

The good people at the Modern Antiquarian list a lot of Grinsell's sources for this rock in 
more detail, and include some other folkore about this area: you can find this (and some photos) on their 
<A href="http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/2343/carreg_leidr.html#folklore" target=_new>Carreg&nbsp;Leidr page</A>.
