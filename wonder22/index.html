"The second wonder is in that place the mountain/large stone that circles by three turns in the year / in a circuit"<SUP><A href="notes/translation.html" target=bottom>1</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/alternatives.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>

<P>
There can be little doubt that this is a folklore wonder, rather than a physical phenomena. If it is a piece of folklore it is much more likely that 
it refers to a large stone that rotates than a mountain. Moving stones are a wellknown folk 
motif<SUP><A href="notes/moving.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP>, and this would be the earliest British example. 

While the wonder doesn't seem to correspond to any current folklore in Anglesey, there is one close contender: the stone <I>Lleidr&nbsp;Tyfrydog</I> or <I>Carreg&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Lleidr</I> 
["Tyfrydog's Thief", or the "Thief's Stone"] at 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/maps/?qs=llandyfryog&countryCode=GB&lon=-4.33880&lat=53.34173&zoom=15&mapData=904&moveMap=0,200" target=_new class=place>Clorach</A>. 
This stone is meant to run three times around its field on one night of the year; this matches the description if the translation is 
taken to refer to a stone which moves three turns around a circle once a year, rather than a mountain that slowly rotates every four months.
