In Nennius, Loch Lomond is "stagnum Lumonoy"; the chapter headings have "De magno lacu Lummonu, qui Anglice vocatur Lochleuen in regione Pictorum"; "Of the great lake Lummonu, which is called in English Loch Leven, in the region of the Picts". The name in modern Welsh form would be <I>Llyn Llumonwy</I>; it is from <I>llumon</I>, a chimney, a beacon, as in <I>Pumlumon</I>, Plynlymon. The tale of Kulhwch arid Olwen recounts how "Kai and Bedwyr sat on a beacon cairn on the summit of Plynlymon". The ending -<I>oy</I>, later -<I>wy</I>, is that in <I>Cornwy</I>, later <I>Kernwy</I> (sic), Cornwall, from <I>Cornavia</I>, "horn-land". Thus Lomond (<I>llumon<I>) is primarily the beacon hill, Ben Lomond; Lumonwy was the district at its base. The Lomond Hills in Fife are, of course, also "beacons", and one has only to look at the peaks of the East and West Lomond to see how well they were suited for that purpose.<A href="../../references/Thomas1935Lumonoy.html">*</A>

The above joins Llyn Llumonwy and Loch Lomond to the west and Loch Levin to the east. 
Both glens are together named after the river Levin. 
Loch Levin was Loch Lomond, most often before the 14 C, but this widening and was used to name the mountain and the area of the lake from that time onwards. A similar coping error is resonsible for the form above, 
for a faulty book-name is more likely than a spoken one.
The pronounciation of northern names uncertainly meets this in the 15 Cent. when there are several examples of this form of language, eg. Eiddin for Eidyn, Lliwelydd for Llywelydd, see Cy. xxviii, p.282.
