If it is true that the wind blew constantly out of our cave 
it seems unlikely that this is due to barometric changes. 
Such changes would be less likely in the summer in Britain, 
particually if the dominant weather systems during this 
period were anticyclonic. This then suggests a chimney-effect 
cave.

In actual fact, the Llangattock Escarpment is well set up for 
all these cave types (save water entrainment caves, as they 
are largely dry now). It has a large plateau above it, 
which would warm fast in summer and cool down rapidly 
in winter, possibly supplying a year round flow down 
through the cave system rather than alternative in directions. 
Equally, it is well placed to funnel winds, and it 
has possibly one of the largest cave systems in the UK under it, 
making it prime for barometric wind storage. In short, there 
are few more prime locations for our cave. It also happens to 
be pretty close to a number of our other sites.
