One factor suggests that if our cave was on the Llangattock scarp  
it might have had this barometric effect, and that is that this tends to effect 
very large cave systems. The caves that have entrances on the 
scarp are probably part of a system that is amongst the longest in Britain.

However, if it is true that the wind blew constantly out of our cave 
it seems unlikely that this was due to barometric changes. 
While the weather conditions at the time the <I>Historia</I> 
was written were probably worse<SUP><A href="notes/DACP.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP> 
it is unlikely Britain suffered much more pressure variation.

This, then, suggests a Chimney Effect 
cave. An escarpment is the perfect place for this, as 
the caves can link the plateau above with the valley below. 
The only downside of this explanation is that there is no 
obvious air outflow or inflow on the plateau above the scarp at Llangattock, 
that is, all the 
obvious cave entrances are on the scarp. That said, 
any outflow need not be through a large and obvious hole.
