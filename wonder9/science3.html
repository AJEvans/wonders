The interesting thing about our description is that while it says that the 
wind occurs all year round, it makes a particular point of noting  
the summer wind. This is a classic chimney effect sign. 
The escarpment makes a fine location for a chimney cave, although there are 
few caves higher than those at quarry-level which might have acted as exits.

In terms of our cave generally being a chimney system, 
it is of relevance to ask what the climate was like 
when our list was being compiled - a short burst of warmer winters 
might have encouraged a more consistent outflow from the base of a 
chimney-effect cave system all year round, at least for a 
while<SUP><A href="notes/reverse.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>. Of course to do this 
we'd need to know when the list was first compiled, which we 
don't. However, if we take the most likely date 
(829 C.E.<SUP><A href="../introduction/notes/date.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>)
it seems likely the winters were a good deal 
worse<SUP><A href="notes/DACP.html" target=bottom>3</A</SUP>.
