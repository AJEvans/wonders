<I>Pwll y Gwynt</I> is a somewhat elusive cave. 
Stratford<A href="../references/Stratford1995Caves.html" target=bottom>*</A> reports it 
as being 285ft (~87m) above <I>Eglwys Faen</I>, but a good deal of 
searching failed to find it. It appears it may actually be about 80m 
above the cave <I>Agen Allwedd</I>, to which it is 
joined<A href="../references/Noel1986Pwll.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(<A href="http://www.cavedatabase.co.uk/showacave.asp?id=3223" target=_new>Map etc.</A>).
