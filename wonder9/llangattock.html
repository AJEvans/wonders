The Llangattock Escarpment is relatively easy to reach 
from Llangattock/Crickhowell, though the final rather steep and tight assent to the

of cars coming down the hill. To find 
<I>Eglwys Faen</I>, head right from the carpark (facing the escarpment) 
and basically just keep going. The scarp heads roughly north-west, before a considerably 
kink to the south-west and back again. The cave is in the corner just before the 
cliff resumes its north-western orientation (<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=319000.990189911&Y=217000.786670384&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=25000&down.x=187&down.y=8" class=place

The cave has one main entrance 
(<A href="photos/llangattock-mainout.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>, 
<A href="photos/llangattock-mainin.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>). Although 
it is somewhat hard to tell, this was probably above the level of quarrying - 
it is certainly the only cave marked on the 1885

This leads to the large cavern (<A href="photos/llangattock-interior.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>) 
that presumably gives the cave its name (translating as "Stone Church"). 
</P>
<P>Quarrying has lead to at least six additional openings 
(<A href="photos/llangattock-entrance1.html" target=right class=photo>Photo 1</A>, 
<A href="photos/llangattock-entrance2.html" target=right class=photo>2</A>,

 <A href="photos/llangattock-entrance5.html" target=right class=photo>5</A>,  
<A href="photos/llangattock-entrancewind.html" target=right class=photo>6</A>), 
one of which (<A href="photos/llangattock-location.html" target=right class=photo>Location Photo</A>; 
<A href="photos/llangattock-entrancewind.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>) has a reasonable flow of air from it, 
even on a calm warm day (12 Sept 2005, 14:00hrs).
