Caves with strong winds blowing from them have a long recorded history, and were classically regarded 
as one of the sources of the wind: 
Greenway<A href="../references/Greenway1996Huntingdon.html" target=bottom>*</A> notes descriptions by  
Seneca<SUP><A href="notes/seneca.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP> (the Younger, in 63 C.E.), 
Lucan<SUP><A href="notes/lucan.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP> (in ~60-65 C.E.) and 
Pliny<SUP><A href="notes/pliny.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP> (the Elder, in 77 C.E.). Infact 
this is a wonder that crops up again and again in British wonder-lists as well. However, after 
the <I>Historia</I> the location seems to move to the 
<A href="http://www.peakdistrict.org/" target=_new>Peak District</A> of Derbyshire.

<P>Both Henry of Huntington<A href="../references/Greenway1996Huntingdon.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
and Ralph de Diceto<A href="../references/Stubbs1876Ralph.html" target=bottom>*</A>   
 in the 12th C. 
(see <A href="../history/otherWonders.html">Other Lists</A>) 
have in their lists of wonders a cave which blows out clothing thrown into it - and both place it 
on "Peak Mountain"<SUP><A href="notes/first.html" target=bottom>4</A></SUP>. These are followed by Alexander of Neckam (late 12th - early 13th C.; quoted by Camden<a href="../references/Camden1607Britannia.html" target=bottom>*</a>: <a href="http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/lincseng.html#derb9" target="_new">Darbyshire</a>) 
who adds it "doth hinder all descent"<A href="../references/Platt2001Wonders.html" target=bottom>*</A>. In the 13th C. both Gervase of Tilbury<A href="../references/Platt2001Wonders.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
and Ranulf Higdon<A href="../references/Platt2001Wonders.html" target=bottom>*</A> include the windy 
Peak cave in their wonders of Britain. William Camden (<a href="../references/Camden1607Britannia.html" target=bottom>*</a>: <a href="http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/lincseng.html#derb9" target="_new">Darbyshire</a>)
ties this to a cave under

target=_new class=place>Peveril Castle</A> known in his time as "The Devil's Arse", only 
to dismiss as nonsense tales of the wind (it is, perhaps, a reflection on our times 
that the cave, long known as <A href="http://www.peakcavern.co.uk/" target=_new>Peak Cavern</A>, 
has now been returned to its former name). Camden is equally dismissive of the notion that 
this is <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=411000.993496673&Y=382000.288758729&width=500&height=300&gride=411478.993496673&gridn=381521.288758729&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=25000&down.x=187&down.y=1" target=_new class=place>Elden Hole</A><SUP><A href="notes/elden.html" target=bottom>5</A></SUP>, the Peak's largest open pothole at 34m (110ft) long,
6m (20ft) wide, and some 82m (270ft) deep<A href="../references/Gill1991Caves.html" target=bottom>*</A>. It is certainly true that in neither case do 
current caving guides<A href="../references/Gill1991Caves.html" target=bottom>*</A> mention strong breezes.
