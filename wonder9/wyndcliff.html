The best way to see the Wynd Cliff is to park at the bottom 
(<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=353000&Y=196000&width=700&height=400&gride=353173.487320352&gridn=193624.986752316&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&up.x=362&up.y=7" target=_new class=place>Map</A>) 
in the carpark on the A466 and walk up it. It's a stiff walk, but worth it for the view 
at the top. It's actually quite hard to get an idea of the cliff as you walk up, as it 
is covered in trees 
(<A href="photos/wyndcliff-up.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>), however, towards the 
top you get to climb up through a cleft in the rock 

(<A href="photos/wyndcliff-cleft1.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>; 
<A href="photos/wyndcliff-cleft2.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>; 
<A href="photos/wyndcliff-cleft3.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>)

which one might imagine would be pretty pit-like if you'd only seen it 
from above.

At the top, turn right, passed what appears to be an unmarked tumulus 
(<A href="photos/wyndcliff-mound.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>), 
and on to the spectacular viewing platform looking out over the Wye 
(<A href="photos/wyndcliff-top.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>). 
Walk round the front under the top platform to find a tiny (partly man-made) 
cave (<A href="photos/wyndcliff-cave.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>) 
- though, sadly, without wind howling from it.
