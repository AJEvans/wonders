British caves without through-flows of air tend to keep a reasonably stable 
temperature at around 7<SUP>o</SUP>C. (~45<SUP>o</SUP>F). In caves with airflow this is 
more complex<SUP><A href="../references/Luetscher2004Temperature.html" target=bottom>*</A></SUP>, 
but they are usually around this temperature. What this 
means is that during the winter, caves are often warmer than the air 
above ground and in the summer they can be a good deal cooler.

Imagine the situation where we have a cave with both a lower and upper entrance, 
as in the diagrams below.  
In the winter warm air can rise out of the cave top and is replaced by colder air 
which, being denser, usually sits around the lower entrance waiting to be 
dragged in. This is known as "The Chimney Effect" as it is seen in 
chimneys which feed fires with oxygen by encouraging exactly this circulation. In the 
cave in summer, the colder air in the cave can run out of the bottom of 
the cave system, being replaced by warmer air drawn in from above.
