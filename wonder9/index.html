"There is another wonderful thing in the area which is called Guent. There is, in that place, a pit, from 
which blows out a wind the whole time without intermission. And when no wind blows in the season of summer, 
from that pit it incessantly blows, such that no one is able to put up with it nor face the pit's depths. 
And the name of it is 'Vith Guint' in the Briton's speech, and in Latin also 'The Blowing Wind'. It is a great wonder 
this wind blows from the earth."<SUP><A href="notes/translation.html" target=bottom>1,</A></SUP><SUP><A href="notes/alternatives.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>

<P>
The difficulty with identifying this site centres on whether you prefer the 
opinion of posterity or a likely identification. 
<I>Guent</I> is almost certainly the kingdom of <I>Gwent</I> in 
South Wales<SUP><A href="notes/gwent.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP>. 
Later Wonder-lists from England include this wonder more obviously  
as a cave (See <A href="myth.html">Myth</A>), but place it outside Gwent. In contrast 
Bradney<A href="../references/Bradney1929History.html" target=bottom>*</A> identifies the site as the 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=352500.487320352&Y=197500.986752316&width=700&height=400&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=&zm=0&scale=50000&multimap.x=355&multimap.y=273" target=_new class=place>Wynd Cliff</A>, 
a very likely location, as it is near Wonders

<A href="../wonder8/index.html" target=right>8</A>;

There aren't any caves 
that really match this description in Gwent now, but all the caves that have winds blowing <I>inside</I> them are around the <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=319000.990189911&Y=217000.786670384&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=25000&down.x=187&down.y=8" class=place target=_new>Llangattock Escarpment</A>, an area where lots of caves have been carved up by quarrying. Two caves 
stand out: <I>Eglwys Faen</I>,  
and <I>Pwll y Gwynt</I> ("Pool of the Wind") directly above 
it<A href="../references/Stratford1995Caves.html" target=bottom>*</A>.

<I>Eglwys Faen</I> has a strong wind just inside one entrance and a weaker breeze 
blowing from another<SUP><A href="notes/eglwys.html" target=bottom>4</A></SUP>, but while the name of 
 

<I>Pwll y Gwynt</I> is suggestive<SUP><A href="notes/pwll.html" target=bottom>5</A></SUP>, 
there isn't actually any record of the cave having 
an outdraft<A href="../references/Stratford1995Caves.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 

The fact that these caves are the only ones associated with winds in 
the Gwent area<SUP><A href="notes/others.html" target=bottom>6</A></SUP>, and their general 
position (see&nbsp;<A href="science.html">Science</A>), might suggest the cave used to be in this area, 
or was even some larger system including these caves, however 
this is very speculative. Bradney's suggestion of the Wynd Cliff seems much more concrete. Though one could argue the 
Wynd Cliff wind doesn't blow "from the earth", there are actually some fairly large clefts in the cliff, up through which 
the wind could run.
