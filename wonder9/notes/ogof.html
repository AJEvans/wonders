It should be noted that any list of the wonders of Britain constructed now 
could do worse than include the cave <I>Porth yr Ogof</I> 
(<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=292500&Y=212500&width=500&height=300&gride=294399.954201971&gridn=208689.639563643&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=50000&multimap.x=270&multimap.y=164" 
target=_new class=place>location</A>) and its 
associated waterfalls. The cave swallows the <I>Afon Mellte</I> in 
one of the largest cave portals in the country. The river then 
flows in a broad canal a few hundred metres underground 
before exiting (and occasionally fountaining) 
into a deep and notoriously deadly cleft. 
The waterfalls which join the <I>Mellte</I> 
downstream include <I>Sgwd Y Eira</I>, a large fall which you can 
walk behind. You can find details of the cave 
<A href="http://www.brecon-beacons.com/porth-yr-ogof.htm" target=_new>here</A> and the 
falls <A href="http://www.brecon-beacons.com/waterfall-country.htm" target=_new>here</A>, 
along with an engraving of the 
cave portal by Henry Gastineau (1829) 
which does it justice <A href="http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/item1/22225" target=_new>here</A>.
Both the cave entrance and falls are worth a visit.
