While <I>Eglwys Faen</I> has 
been "known of for a long time"<A href="../../references/Stratford1995Caves.html" target=bottom>*</A>, <I>Pwll y Gwynt</I> was found, 
at least in the modern era, in 1981 and the name dates from 
then<A href="../../references/Stratford1995Caves.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
Generally, however, caves are named appropriately. It is now relatively 
inaccessible as it is high up the scarp, though would probably 
have been more easily reached before the quarry (see <A href="../llangattock.html" target=_right>Visit Details</A>).
