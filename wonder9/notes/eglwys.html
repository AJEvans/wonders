<I>Eglwys Faen</I> has a strong draft just inside the cave<a href="../../references/Stratford1995Caves.html" target="bottom">*</a> and from one exit 
(see <A href="../llangattock.html" target=right>Visit Details</A>). However, there has been at least 
six openings carved into the system by quarrying lower than the main entrance. It is 
not clear whether this is responsible for the draft, or whether these new openings 
have dispersed it, however, a visit on a warm and calm day (12 Sept 2005, 14:00hrs) found the 
cave still had a cool breeze blowing out of it (see <A href="../llangattock.html" target=right>Visit Details</A>).
