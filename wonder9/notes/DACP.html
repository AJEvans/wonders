The period between the most likely date of composition at 829 C.E and the 
age of the manuscript which is likely to be the oldest recording 
(<A href="../../history/manuscripts.html#A" target=right>A</A>: c.1100  C.E.) 
was probably a period of considerable climatic change. 
Current thinking is broadly that there was a "Roman Warm Period" 
ending in ~100 B.C.E., followed by a 
"Dark Ages Cold Period" ("DACP") ending ~900 C.E.<A href="../../references/Bianchi1999Holocene.html" target=bottom>*</A>
 and then a 
"Medieval Warm Period" 
("MWP" : <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period" target=-new>Summary</A>)
ending ~1250 C.E.<A href="../../references/Bianchi1999Holocene.html" target=bottom>*</A> before the 
"Little Ice Age" 
(<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_ice_age" target=_new>Summary</A>)
which we climbed out of in the ~1850s.

Because of its position as a possible analogue for future climate change, 
and its display of naturally-induced warming, the MWP has received far more 
attention than the DACP, though the existence of both has generally been the 
source of much controversy<A href="../../references/Mann1999Northern.html" target=bottom>*</A><A href="../../references/McDermott2001Centennial.html" target=bottom>*</A><A href="../../references/Esper2002Low.html" target=bottom>*</A><A href="../../references/Bradley2003Climate.html" target=bottom>*</A><A href="../../references/Bradley2000Years.html" target=bottom>*</A>. Recent work has generally 
proved their existence, and whether<A href="../../references/Esper2002Low.html" target=bottom>*</A><A href="../../references/Lamb1965Early.html" target=bottom>*</A> or not<A href="../../references/Bradley2003Climate.html" target=bottom>*</A><A href="../../references/Crowley2000Causes.html" target=bottom>*</A>
 the MWP was warmer than today, 
it seems likely the DACP was somewhat cooler<A href="../../references/McDermott2001Centennial.html" target=bottom>*</A>.

Work on multiple sources (including manuscript records and even vinyard 
locations) by Lamb<A href="../../references/Lamb1965Early.html" target=bottom>*</A> suggested that the DACP lasted long enough to 
bring a series of severe winters to Britain in 830-870 C.E. with cyclonic weather 
dominant, before the MWP at 1000 C.E. He suggests the MWP saw dominantly anti-cyclonic weather over Europe (but with milder winters for Britain than expected) and warm summers, with wet periods 
900-1060 C.E. and after 1300.

Subsequent researchers have always been impressed by Lamb's research, but somewhat 
more circumspect about his conclusions, based, as they largely are, on contemporary 
accounts rather than "scientific" data. However, the broad trend of a period of colder than present annual conditions followed by a period at or just above current temperatures, particularly in the 

Summer<A href="../../references/Bradley2000Years.html" target=bottom>*</A>, seems accepted. It seems like there may be a longer-term 1500 year 
cycle of temperatures in the North Atlantic (at least), though causes suggested range from 
fluctuations in the ocean-atmosphere system<A href="../../references/Bianchi1999Holocene.html" target=bottom>*</A> to changes in solar inputs and volcanic eruptions<A href="../../references/Crowley2000Causes.html" target=bottom>*</A><A href="../../references/Bradley2000Years.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
