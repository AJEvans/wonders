<P>
Warmer winter temperatures would mean that on more occasions 
the air in the cave would be colder than the outside air, and the 
air-flow would continue from the base of the system. 
</P>
<P>
Equally, colder summer temperatures would make it more likely that 
hot air from the <I>fovea</I> ("pit") would rise out during the summer. 
However, it is very unlikely the wonder records the top of such a cave, 
as to get a continuous summer wind from the top of a chimney system 
the summer temperature would have to be consistently falling, year on year, 
below the annual average. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, even under very severe weather changes, this would only 
last until the walls surrounding the cave reached equilibrium with the 
average annual temperature. After this the normal seasonal cycle 
would kick in.
