Elden Hole [also "Eldon" Hole] (<A href="http://www.geograph.co.uk/photo/44896" target=_new clas=photo>Photo</A>) 
provides a pretty representative picture of the evolution of 
a 'wonder'. 
</P>
<P>
Known since at least the 1500's, it has always excited curiosity. Initially this took an 
exploratory, if you will, "scientific" form.  
The Earl of Leicester 
(<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Dudley%2C_1st_Earl_of_Leicester" target=_new>Biography</A>) initiated a long tradition of gentlemen doing their wonder/death-trap exploration 
vicariously, through humble people who expect nothing. 
He apparently lowered "a man" down to the bottom of the Hole, only to retrieve him in shock, and to die a 
short while after<A href="../../references/Valentine1894Picturesque.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
</P>
<P>
However, the cave's apparently bottomless nature marked it out as a "wonder". 
It was obviously regarded as such by at least 1586, when it is mentioned by 
Camden<a href="../../references/Camden1607Britannia.html" target=bottom>*</a>: <a href="http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/lincseng.html#derb9" target="_new">Darbyshire</a>) 
- though he only brings it up to mention that, while it <I>is</I> a wonder, 
it's not as strange as some suggest. Despite this, such wonders 
rapidly moved onto the general tourist circuit.

Thomas Hobbs' (<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes" target=_new>Biography</a>) 
1626 trip around the Peak area inspired him to produce 
his long poem <I>De Mirabilibus Pecci</I> 
(1636<A href="../../references/Hobbs1678Mirabilibus.html" target=bottom>*</A>) 
which includes the hole, apparently in 
scurrilous terms<A href="../../references/Platt2001Wonders.html" target=bottom>*</A>, 
and may have led to him appearing as <I>Accident</I> 
in Ben Jonson's 1633 play 'The King's Entertainment at Welbeck.' The character 
notes "Elden, bottomlesse, like Hell"<A href="../../references/Martinich1998Jonson.html" target=bottom>*</A>, 
suggesting that even those in London were familiar with it. 
</P>
<P>
A little later, Celia Fiennes' 
(<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celia_Fiennes" target=_new>Biography</A>) 1697 tour 
diary<A href="../../references/Fiennes1702England.html" target=bottom>*</A> shows 
even the most rationally minded about the 
hole could still be drawn into its folklore, for after a long exposition on 
how deep the hole may be, she suggests it is impossible for a wall to remain 
around it, and animals are dragged into it against their nature.

Even the usually cynical Daniel DeFoe (<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Defoe" 
target=_new>Biography</A>) still quoted it as being a Wonder in 1724, 
and relates the, doubtless common, belief that it may go to the centre of the 
earth - offering as proof that 
"Mr Cotton... let down eight hundred fathoms of line into it...in a word, he sounded about a mile perpendicular."<A href="../../references/DeFoe1724Tour.html" target=bottom>*</A>

Karl Philipp Moritz (<A href="http://www.nndb.com/people/295/000094013/" target=_new>Biography</A>) visited in 1782, and commented on a local story that a goose 
was once thrown into it, and emerged at Peak Cavern - entirely 
defeathered<A href="../../references/Moritz1782England.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
</P>
<P> 
The hole remained on the tourist circuit even after John Lloyd Esq., F.R.S. made 
his 1770<A href="../../references/PeakHeritageEldon.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(1713?<A href="../../references/White1857Directory.html" target=bottom>*</A>) descent into it to measure its true depth. 
Doubtless it did so until the people of Britain could afford to 
go and see something rarer than a hole in the ground - the beaches of 
southern Spain, perhaps. 
Eldon Hole has now retreated into quieter obscurity, visited largely by 
cavers wanting a nice abseil and prusik trip. If the wonders 
in our collection are anything to go by, it should be considering itself 
fortunate in that...
