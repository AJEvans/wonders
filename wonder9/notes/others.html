At least according to Stratford<A href="../../references/Stratford1995Caves.html" target=bottom>*</A>, 
which is the classic caving guide to the area. However, the recently extended

(1994: if "extended" can adequately cover 66km of new passage:

<A href="http://bwb.brinkster.net/showacave.asp?id=3225" target=_new>Info</A>) was previously 
only known as a short passage ending in a blockage, from behind which came a strong wind. 
On the basis of these details, it is hard to assess whether this cave would be appropriate. 
However, as it is in more or less the same position and geology as the 
Llangattock caves, only across a dividing valley, it would seem to back up the general 
likelihood of the cave being in this area.

Two additionally interesting caves are listed by Oldham<A href="../../references/Oldham1992Southern.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
The first he quotes from the "Cambrian Travellers Guide" of 1813: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The other [cave is] called the 
windhole... its depth from the entrance measures 27 yards [24.6m]. There are two or three fissures 
through the roof of the cavern to the land above, and a considerable distance from the edge 
of the cliff; over which a hat is placed it will be blomn[sic] back into the air with considerable violence, but this only happens when the wind blows fresh from the south-east.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Oldham notes that this is shown on 'the sixth inch series' maps as <I>Pwll-y-Gwynt</I>. Unfortunately 
its location, east of Ogmore-by-sea (on the cliffs next to

The second cave he mentions is quite bizarre. He claims that every 10 seconds, for 5 seconds, 
it breathes out a warm, steam-like, breath ("the dragon's breath") 
which is off-putting for anyone who'd like to enter. He suggests it might be 
from an underground fire, or gas from decomposing organic material.

This matches with a suggestion by 
Edens<A href="../../references/Edens2003Dragon.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
that the translation of <I>Gwynt</I> should be "flatulent" and/or "blast", and 
that the wonder is actually a methane outlet from a coalfield, hence its impenetrability. 
Pliny the Elder lists a number of deadly cave winds in his 
<I>Naturalis Historia</I><SUP><A href="pliny.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>, but these 
are largely in more active geological areas where volcanic gases are likely.   

That the <I>Historia</I> should be describing methane seems somewhat unlikely - the description 
would surely have noted the explosive nature of any such outlet 
more explicitly, and the Latin seems to match the standard interpretation. 
Either way, Oldham's cave is unlikely to 
be the wonder, as it is in 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=285500&Y=179000&width=500&height=300&gride=285403&gridn=179022&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=pc&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=CF320NE&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=1&scale=25000" class=place target=_new>Tythegston Quarry</A> 
and, therefore, a good distance from Gwent. It should 
be noted that the cave is probably not marked on the

Additional caves outside the area with suggestive 
names include Gut Hole, on the Gower, and Hot Air Mine in the Swansea valley, both of 
which can be found in Stratford<A href="../../references/Stratford1995Caves.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
