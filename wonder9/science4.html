A different pressure effect caused by the weather 
can make air flow into and out of caves even when they 
have only one major exit. Britain, as a mid-latitude maritime country, 
suffers an alternating sequence of high and low pressure air masses 
(See <A href="http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7p.html" target=_new>here</A>  and 
<A href="http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7s.html" target=_new>here</A> for an explanation). 
As these move across an area containing a cave system, the high pressure 
can force air into large cave systems where it can be 
stored, particually in those caves in cracked and porous 
limestone. When the weather front has passed and the low pressure 
zone is over the cave, the pressure in the cave is higher 
than the surrounding air, and the stored air can be exhaled 
from the cave, almost like a huge lung. This "Barometric Wind" 
has been used to calculate the likely size of caves 
where it is suspected there might be hidden
