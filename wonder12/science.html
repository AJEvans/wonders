Conglomerates are geological history writ large. More than any other 
stone they capture the vast eras of geological action. Because they 
are made up of rocks which have been deposited, altered to rock, eroded 
into rounded blocks or pebbles, moved and redeposited, then cemented together to make stone again, 
they contain a massive amount of information about an area. However, they also   
reminding us of our huge ignorance of much of geological history.

The conglomerate of Carn Gafallt formed in the 
Lower Silurian Period 'Llandovery' 
Epoch<A href="../references/BGSLexiconCBN.html" target=bottom>*</A> (~444 to 428 Million years ago: 
<A href="http://www.stratigraphy.org/paleo.htm" target=_new>Timeline</A>), 
when most of mid-Wales was deep under the  
sea. Rocks eroded from the land built up in the shallows at the 
edge of the sea, then  slid down in 
submarine channels in the continental shelf in giant avalanches. 
These rocks and pebbles mixed with mud and other deposits. 
This mixture built up and the pressure of layer upon layer of mud, followed by 
later material, slowly turned 
the mix at the bottom into the rock we see today. The older 
rock pebbles in this particular conglomerate are the hardest bits, so they 
tend to be easily released from the cement-like <I>matrix</I> around them, 
leaving hemispherical indents in the rock.
