...if we are surprised to find this singular hunt thus recorded, and even the name of Arthur's dog 
Cavall preserved in connection with it, much more may we be astonished to learn that Carn Cavall 
is no fabulous mound, the creation of the poet or romancer's fancy, but is actually a mountain 
in the district of Builth, to the south of Rhayader Gwy, and within sight of that town. Such 
was the interest excited in my mind by the discovery of the existence of such a remarkable 
piece of evidence, corroborative of the great antiquity of the traditions contained in the 
Mabinogi of Kilhwch, that I prevailed upon a gentleman to undertake a pilgrimage for me 
to the summit of Cefn Carn Cavall. The following is the account he wrote me of his 
expedition; whether he has succeeded in finding the stone itself, bearing the imprint 
of Cavall's footstep, I must leave to others to determine.
