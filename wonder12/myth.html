The hunt for the boar Troynt is almost certain to be the hunt for 
the Trwch Trwyth<SUP><A href="notes/age.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>  
("Boar King-Boar"<A href="../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target=bottom>*</A> - the prouncation is similar) 
which is described in the medieval tale of Culhwch and Olwen 
(<A href="../twrch/myth.html" target=right>Details</A>). 

In the tale, Arthur tells his warriors that the pig was once a sinful king, transformed by  
god into a boar as punishment<SUP><A href="notes/discussion.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>.
Arthur has to collect a number of treasures fixed to the pig in order to help Culhwch win Olwen.

<P>
First, however, he has to kill a preliminary boar <I>Ysgithrwyn Ben Beidd</I>  
("White Tusk Chief of Boars"<A href="../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target=bottom>*</A>). He is helped 
in this by his dog Cavall (previously written <I>Cabal</I>) who, infact, kills the boar. Cavall then goes on to help Arthur hunt the 
Twrch Trwyth.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately there is no mention of the wonder in Culhwch and Olwen, and, indeed, as 
can be seen on this <A href="../twrch/map.html">Map</A>, the route of the hunt as given in 
the tale goes nowhere near Carn Gafallt. This suggests the myth of the hunt, for whatever 
reason<SUP><A href="notes/reasons.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP>, took in a broader range of areas than that in the story.

<P>
Footprints in stone are a classic wonder<SUP><A href="notes/tatheus.html" target=bottom>4</A></SUP>, reported across 
Britain. Bord<A href="../references/Bord2004Footprints.html" target=bottom>*</A> has collected over a hundred of them, 
forty-three from Britain alone,  
and details of the footprints of Arthur's various animals from around Britain can be 
found at Thomas Green's <A href="http://www.arthuriana.co.uk/concepts/folkgazt.htm" target=_new>Arthurian Gazetteer</A>.
