Given this is a cairn associated with a possible dog or horse (See 
<A href="horse.html">Note 4</A>) it is worth looking at whether either 
might have been the original occupant of one of the cairns. It has to be said 
that it seems very unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that the burial of animals in Britain isn't known 
from either the period of the legend or the cairn (See <A href="cairn.html" target=bottom>Note&nbsp;6</A>). Taking the probably 
age of the legend first: the burial of both horses and dogs is known from Iron Age 
and Roman Britain (burials are to be distinguished from deposition, 
though this is not always an easy distinction, even with 
fully articulated skeletons<A href="../../references/Sykes2004Animals.html" target=bottom>*</A>).
</P>
<P>
Generally in the Iron Age dogs were buried within settlement areas, and therefore it is often hard to determine 
the reason for burial (some, for example, may be pets or the by-product of 
pelt removal<A href="../../references/Sykes2004Animals.html" target=bottom>*</A>). 
Iron Age horse burials can warrant more physical evidence of ritualistic treatment 
(see, for examples, the burial at Nosterfield<A href="../../references/Griffiths2004Horse.html" target=bottom>*</A>) 
and the general importance of horses to Iron Age British societies is shown in 
their images on coins (see, for example, the Sedgeford hoard 
[<A href="http://www.sharp.org.uk/itemsofinterest/hoard.htm" target=_new>Images and Info</A>])
</P>
<P>
Romano-British dog burials were extensive and include, for example, 
some larger "dog cemeteries"<A href="../../references/Kennedy2002Dogs.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
In some cases there seems to have been the protective addition of dogs to the graves of the 
young<A href="../../references/Powers2004Annual.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
but possibly also an association with 
child sacrifice<A href="../../references/Taylor2003Burial.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the likely age of the cairns, both horse and dog burials are much rarer in the 
Bronze Age (following the trend for human burials). Horses and/or dogs were certainly 
important in the Bronze Age 
(see the White Horse (or Dog) of Uffington<A href="../../references/Newman1999Symbols.html" target=bottom>*</A>, for example)
but physical remains tend to be associated with human burials 
(see, for example, Horse at Poulton<A href="../../references/Emery2004Poulton.html" target=bottom>*</A>, or 
late Neolithic Dog at Cuween Cairn [<A href="http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/tombs/cuween/" target=_new>Info</A>]).

<P>
It is difficult to say what or who was buried at Carn Gafallt. Although 
the frequent destruction of surface features where animal burials <I>have</I> been found 
means it is impossible to say that cairns weren't built over them, it is extremely 
unlikely a lone animal would have been treated in such a manner.  

That said, we can give some thin credence to the idea that an animal burial might be 
important enough to warrant a name in the Welsh landscape as we have 
the dubious evidence of Beddgelert ("the grave of Gelert"): traditionally said to be 
named after the grave of a early medieval dog (<A href="http://www.irishwolfhounds.org/gelert.htm" target=_new>Details</A>). 
Heck, if Alexander the Great can get away with it...
