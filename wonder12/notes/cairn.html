<P>
The cairns on Carn Gafallt are likely to be bronze age<A href="../../references/CPATHLCCarn.html">*</A>, 
based on the fact that four middle-bronze-age gold torcs were found on the hill under one of the 
lesser stone-piles which litter the area<A href="../../references/CPATHLCElan.html">*</A>. In addition, their 
general form (stone cairns) and location (near a hilltop) suggests a bronze age - for 
other examples from Wales, see Browne and Hughes<A href="../../references/BrownHughes2003Uplands.html">*</A>.
Arthur, however, such as he is, is largely regarded as a Dark Age hero - at best (if we ignore the 
earliest written sources 
and wildly speculate) extending back to the Romano-British or Iron Age.
