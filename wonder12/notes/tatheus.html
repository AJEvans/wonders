An example which is probably of a similar age can be found in the 
Life of St. Tatheus 
(<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/tatheus.html" target=_new>English Translation</A>) in 
which a stolen cow leaves a hoofprint miraculously imprinted in stone. While this 
life was written in the 12th C., it deals with a 'Dark Age' period and is probably 
built on earlier materials. It centres, along with the life of 
St. Gwynllyw (<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/gwynllyw.html" target=_new>English Translation</A>) and a number of other British saints' lives, on the 
coastal plain of the Severn, where many of our wonders lie.
