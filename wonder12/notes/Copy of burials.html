 Another animal that may have had some ritual significance was the dog for dog burials appear in places like the entrances to settlements and hillforts and they are often found in farming communities.

Gelert’s burial place gave its name to a town Beddgelert (grave of Gelert)

Ritual burials of dogs are known from the Iron Age and Roman periods in Britain, and as possible animal sacrifices in richly furnished graves. In ritual shafts at Springfield, Kent, small dogs (suggested to be sacrificial) were found buried in baskets with neonates (newborns). Two complete dogs were found in Roman London's eastern cemetery and appeared contemporary with its use as a place of human interment. Animal burials have even been suggested to form the focal point for the development of cemeteries, but few references can be found to inclusion of dogs directly with the deceased.

Dating from c 3000BC, Cuween Cairn, at the top of a hill near Finstown, was fashioned by cutting into solid bedrock. Like many prehistoric tombs, the main chamber has others branching from it. Experiencing this tomb requires crawling on hands and knees through a narrow passage about three feet high. The main chamber of the tomb is lit during the autumn equinox, when the sun’s rays align with the entranceway. The skulls of 24 dogs lay inside, and archaeologists can only guess at the reasons why—perhaps a sacrifice.

In addition to dedicated sanctuaries, the entrance to a city seems to have been a particularly important ritual area as well. In many British hillforts, ritual pits have been found at the entrance and along the principal roadway with horses, humans, and more rarely dogs, are buried there. It is unclear whether the human burials represent sacrifice or merely deposition near town.

Uffington White Horse and its Landscape
Investigations at White Horse Hill Uffington, 1989-95 and Tower Hill Ashbury, 1993-4.
by D Miles, S Palmer, G Lock, C Gosden and A M Cromarty
Oxford Archaeology Thames Valley Landscapes Monograph 18 (2003)
ISBN 0947816771

 Current Archaeology Issue 142 White Horse Hill - Dating (Miles & Palmer)
Page: 372-384 The White Horse is a prime example of Celtic art, carved into the hillside in Berkshire and scoured white from time immemorial. David Miles has been investigating and the Oxford Laboratory has come up with some new dates based on the new technique of silt dating, which suggest that the White Horse is Bronze Age. Which do you believe? Do you believe in science? Or do you believe that such an obvious example of Celtic Art could not possibly date to the Bronze Age?
