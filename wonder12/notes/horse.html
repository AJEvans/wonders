The legend of Carn Cabal is likely to be a so-called "onomastic legend", that is, one which explains a name. 
Historians Rachel Bromwich and Simon Evans have  
suggested<A href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target=bottom>*</A> that Cafal (pronounced "Caval", and previously written "Cabal" 
as in the <I>Historia</I>) 
is related to the British word for a horse, not a dog 
(<I>Cafall</I> "horse" from the Latin 
<I>caballus</I><A href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target=bottom>*</A> cp. one modern Welsh word for "horse" <I>ceffyl</I>, 
cf. <I>ci</I>/<I>ki</I> "dog"). 

As it seems unlikely Arthur would have called a good hound "horse" (unless it was as fast as one) it 
would appear on the strength of this that the cairn name came first, and the dog 
was given the name of the cairn without a thought to the origin because of the wonderful paw-print. 

As further evidence Bromwich and Evans note the double meaning of <I>carn</I> as both "cairn" and "hoof" and the 
fact that two places in Meirionnydd (<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merioneth" target=_new>Area</A>) 
are named <I>Carreg Carn March Arthur</I> ("The rock cairn/hoof of Arthur's Horse"):  
probably the rock next to Llyn Barfog 
[<A href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/cfwm/cf106.htm" target=_new>Info</A> :

: <A href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/47272" target=_new>Photo</A>] and 
that at Loggerheads 
[<A href="http://www.colomendy.liv.org.uk/BoundaryDispute.htm" target=_new>Info/Photo</A> : 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=320000&Y=362000&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=true&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=25000&multimap.x=279&multimap.y=56" target=_new class=place>Map</A> : 
<A href="http://digidol.llgc.org.uk/METS/ING00001/ingleviewer?item=67&locale=cy" target=_new>Drawing</A>],
both of which are associated with legendary hoof-prints of a similar type. 
</P>
<P>This suggestion is strengthened by the initial mention of Cavall 
(<I>Kauall</I> <A href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target=bottom>*</A>line&nbsp;337 / 
<I>Cauall</I> <A href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target=bottom>*</A>line&nbsp;739) in the tale of Culhwch and Olwen 
(<a href="../../twrch/myth.html" target="right">Details</a>) as one of the three horses 
(<I>meirch</I> <A href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target=bottom>*</A>line&nbsp;337) of  
Bwlch, Chyuwlch, and Seuwlch, the sons of Kledyf Kyuwlch - the first two 
being Call ("Sharp/Wily") and Kuall ("Speedy")<A href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(cf. Guest's translation<A href="../../references/Guest1877Mabinogion.html" target=bottom>*</A>, 
which suggests a less-likely punctuation that renders these animals dogs). 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in the tale, by the time Arthur is hunting the boar <I>Ysgithrwyn Ben Beidd</I>, 
Cavall 
(<I>Chauall</I> <A href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target=bottom>*</A>line&nbsp;1015,
<A href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target=bottom>*</A>line&nbsp;1108 / 
<I>Kauall</I> <A href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target=bottom>*</A>line&nbsp;1021) 
is his dog, and, indeed, kills the boar. Cavall then goes on to help Arthur hunt the giant boar, the 
Twrch Trwyth. Bromwich and Evans have suggest that once the cairn had been associated with the dog by the 
list in the <I>Historia</I>, 
the name would have easily been picked up by the author of this 
tale<A href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target=bottom>*</A>. This is further 
picked up in the tale 
<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/gereint2.html" target=_new>Chwedl Geraint fab Erbin</A><A href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
which mentions Cavall as the name of Arthur's dog.</P>
<P>
As the <A href="../gafallt.html" target=right>Visit Details</A> show, there is plenty of potential 
for finding dog-sized prints in the area, but this doesn't extend to 
horse-hoof sizes, possibly demanding the name, originally associated with a horse, became linked with the dog. 
There has, however, been no evidence of horse-burials or similar from the area 
so it is not clear what the origin of the name is either way. 
One faint possibility may be that "Cabal" is, instead, related to the Latin root 
<I>Cap</I> which forms words about snatching and seizing, including our "capture", 
and that the dog name really did come first.
