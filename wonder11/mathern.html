The Severn once came up a great deal closer to St. Theodorick's Church in 
Mathern than it does now. To see where the old inlet was, go first to the Church, 
walk through the graveyard to the back. The graveyard backs onto a shallow valley. 
From the graveyard wall you can see the pond in the 
grounds of the palace of the Bishops of Llan D&#226;v 
(<A href="photos/mathern-pool.html" class=photo>Photo</A>).  
Follow the footpath out from the back of the graveyard,    
down the slope and into the field. Take the 
path left towards the Severn. From here you can see the palace 
next to the church (<A href="photos/mathern-church.html" class=photo>Photo</A>).  
Although the field the path follows seems to slope away from the 
Severn, this is apparently an optical illusion, as the path 
follows a streambed (dry in September 2005) which leads 
from next to Tewdric's Well, passed the church, and down to the river. 
This small valley has, in the past, been an 
inlet<A href="../references/Cadw2002Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A>,  
and, in a case of mythological wish-fulfilment, there are even 
some planks across the stream (<A href="photos/mathern-planks.html" class=photo>Photo</A>).

To reach the main area of the old Pill / Creek continue 
down the path to the St. Pierre manor grounds. 
Sadly, where heros once trod there is now a golf-course 
full of business executives, but you can follow the footpath 
across the course - preferably waving your arms like a 
lunatic and screaming in Old Welsh - to the last 
remnants of the streams that used to be the main body 
of St. Pierre Pill - the probable Pwll Meyric.
