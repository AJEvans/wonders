Mathern (in Welsh <I>Merthyr Tewdric</I> "the martyrdom-location of Tewdric") is certainly the most obvious location associated with Meurig  
where the water may have reached at high tide (see <A href="pwll.html" target=bottom>Note</A>). 
It sits next to 
a stream called the Meurig (now "Mounton brook")<A href="../../references/Kellys1901Monmouthshire.html">*</A>. 
and has a number of springs, pools, and wells. 
However, the exact location of the wonder is tricky to discern, if for 
no other reason that it is actually quite hard to work out which 
well might be the one under discussion.
</P>
<P>
On the various maps of the area there are two wells 
(one north of village, currently dedicated to St.Tewdric [<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=352000&Y=192000&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=pc&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=25000&down.x=186&down.y=6" 
target=_new class=place>map</A> with well marked] and <A href="http://www.old-maps.co.uk/oldmaps/servlet/RawImageServlet?application=oldmaps&command=omStartup.sh&operation=display&save=OFF&imageList=/datar/raid5/13glou1/ep1/13062NW1.TIF&projParams=33%2032767%202%209%206377563.3959999997%200.0066705398%201.0000000000%200.0000000000%20-1.1972600222%2050.6177062988%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000&westTM=351821.0&eastTM=352499.0&southTM=190723.2&northTM=191084.8&zoomLevel=1&winWidth=600&winHeight=320" target=new class=place>Ivy House Well</A>).
There are also two obvious springs 
(the current start of the unnamed stream running passed the church, as shown next to 
St.Tewdric's well on the 1:50000 map (above), and that 500m east 
of the village), and two pools/ponds (see <A href="pwll.html" target=bottom>Note</A>). None match up consistently with the discription from the <I>Historia</I>.
</P>

<P>
The unfortunate problem is that the most obvious well in the village is that currently dedicated to St.Tewdric<A href="../../references/Jones1954Wells.html">*</A><A href="../../references/Thomas2004Sacred.html">*</A><A href="../../references/Wellsprings2000Monmouthshire.html">*</A>  
(see <A href="../myth.html" target=right>Myth</A>), leaving us to ask whether there was a additional well 
explicitly dedicated to Meurig. The Ivy House well, if indeed it ever existed, is not marked 
on modern maps. The prevailing belief seems to 
place Meurig's well itself as lost somewhere in Pwllmeyric 
(for example Thomas<A href="../../references/Thomas2004Sacred.html">*</A>), 
however it is far from obvious that such a thing even existed (See Notes on <A href="pwllmeyric.html">Pwllmeyric</A> 
and the <A href="pwll.html">Pwll</A>). One could, for example, imagine the writer meaning "the well 
named by Meurig".
</P>
<P>
An alternative translation of the second line of the wonder is given by 
Davies<A href="../../references/Davies1990Mathern.html" target=bottom>*</A>: "There is there a well near the valley of the pool Maurit (Meurig) and a log in the middle of the well." This works well for the 
location as it negates having to find a well dedicated to Meurig, and instead allows us to 
locate the wonder using <I>Pull Mouric</I> (See <A href="pwll.html">Note on Pwll</A>). It is the 
suspicion that this is true which leads one to  suggest the area around Pwllmeyric for the wonder, 
but unfortunately there seems to be little reason for accepting "pool" for <I>putei</I> 
(see <A href="translation.html" target=bottom>Note on Translation</A> for original - it's also not clear where "Maurit" 
originates: for known variations see <A href="alternatives.html" target=bottom>Note on Alternatives</A>). 
Given this, the Mathern location can only be held somewhat speculatively.

If, rather than the well, we take the spring as the starting point, we don't 
get much futher.
The 1886 map of the area suggests the unnamed stream running next to 
St. Tewdric's Well and the church used to run overland much further north than it does now, and that the 
stream is therefore a re-issue rather than a spring. This is confirmed by the current 
1:10000 map which notes it as an "issue" rather than a "spring", and shows other stretches of 
the same stream further north, albeit not following the course it appears to have in 1886. However, 
it does appear from the 1:10000 data that the stream is joined by a small outlet from another, real, 
spring in the estate some 70m or so to the north.

The second spring near the Mathern, some 500m east of the village, 
appears on the current and 1886 maps. While this 
is closer to a pool (see <A href="pwll.html">Note on Pwll</A>), there is no well there. Of course, springs can come 
and go - a groundsman in the grounds of Pwllmeyric House, when questioned about it, indicated that springs 
came and went on the land on a frequent basis.

<P>
The confusion is added to by the fact that 
Tewdric's church in Mathern is known under 
his latinized name of Theodorick, and that 
the 1886 <A href="http://www.old-maps.co.uk/oldmaps/servlet/RawImageServlet?application=oldmaps&command=omStartup.sh&operation=display&save=OFF&imageList=/datar/raid5/13glou1/ep1/13062NW1.TIF;/datar/raid5/13glou1/ep1/13054SW1.TIF&projParams=33%2032767%202%209%206377563.3959999997%200.0066705398%201.0000000000%200.0000000000%20-1.1972600222%2050.6177062988%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000&westTM=352734.0&eastTM=353412.0&southTM=192200.2&northTM=192561.8&zoomLevel=1&winWidth=600&winHeight=320" target=new class=place>Map</A> of the area shows a church dedicated

Given all this, you may feel that you might as well stick a pin in a map. However, given the 
absence of any information on the existence of a well in the area 500m east of the town, it seems 
likely that the wonder, if it was here at all, was somewhere in the inlet to the 
south-west of the church, between the level of the current golf-course 
and St.Tewdric's Well. Plainly, though, this is somewhat speculative.
