It seems likely that the original "Pwll Mouric" was, infact, the 
inlet now called <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=352500&Y=190000&width=500&height=300&gride=352810.457116879&gridn=191362.710147059&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=50000&multimap.x=223&multimap.y=184" target=_new class=place>St.Pierre's Pill</A>, which has a much more restricted 
reach than it once had. The first Ordnance Survey maps from the early 1800's 
show that the inlet essentially went back to Mathern 
(<A href="../map.html" target=right>Map</A>). Prior to this there had been 
some landscaping of the area (the large lake at St. Pierre House), however, the 
tidal zone really became restricted after the 
coastal railway was built (1886 <A href="http://www.old-maps.co.uk/oldmaps/servlet/RawImageServlet?application=oldmaps&command=omStartup.sh&operation=display&save=OFF&imageList=/datar/raid6/50monm1/ep1/50031001.TIF&projParams=33%2032767%202%209%206377563.3959999997%200.0066705398%201.0000000000%200.0000000000%20-3.5713799000%2051.6407394409%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000%200.0000000000&westTM=351687.0&eastTM=352365.0&southTM=189513.2&northTM=189874.8&zoomLevel=1&winWidth=600&winHeight=320" target=_new class=map>Map</A>),

to provide a harbour). In the deeper past, comparison with other pills along 
the Severn (See <A href="../../wonder6/index.html" target=right>Wonder 6</A>, for example), settlement sites, and the geological maps for the area 
suggests the estuary went further up some inlets than is recorded on maps. 
Estate maps and surveys from the 16 and 17th<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN> suggest that at least 
part of the land was reclaimed and/or marsh by then<A href="../../references/Rippon1996Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A>, though even now the area of the old inlet is marshy and requires considerable drainage. 
</P>





<P>
The inlet takes its current name from the 12th C. knight and local landowner Roger de St Pierre<A href="../../references/SaundersEvans1998Gwent.html">*</A>. 
 There is, however, 
reasonable evidence that the name of the majority of the inlet was <I>Pull Muric</I> before this. 
from the Book of Llan D&#226;v (see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>).  
This was compiled from the 12th&nbsp;C. onwards from current and older materials and    
includes a number of descriptions of ecclesiastical boundaries with details 
professing to be from the time of Mouric, including boundaries running along the <I>Pull Muric</I> that 
make it explicit that this ran down to the Severn.
</P>
<P>
Translations of these given by Evans<A href="../../references/Evans1893Llandav.html" target=bottom>*</A>  include the following description of the area given by Meurig to the church of Llan D&#226;v after his father's death:

<P>
However, the words in bold are in interpolations by Evans suggesting places. The 
Meurig brook (now "Mounton brook")<A href="../../references/Kellys1901Monmouthshire.html">*</A>
does run into the inlet, however the 
text itself simply reads "<I>Finis Oaper pull Muric [in margin: pul Muryc]  sursum yrpull</I>" and "<I>yoggou betaper muric [in margin: vet aber meuruc]</I>".
</P>
<P>
A survey of 1578 to determine the havens and creeks of the County of Newport lists 
Pill Merrick, St.Pierre and Mathern separately<A href="../../references/Rippon1996Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A>, which may suggest there was an intermediate stage in the 
development of the area when there were three separate names and harbours 
recognised within the inlet, before it took the name St.Pierre's Pill.
</P>
<P>
The likelihood that the inlet is the <I>Pwll</I> is supported by the 
name of such inlets along the Severn, which are known 
generally as <I>Pills</I>. This appears to be a corruption of <I>Pwll</I> 
 suggesting 
the term could refer to creeks as well as inland pools 
(though c.f. Rippon<A href="../../references/Rippon1996Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A> in 
which it is suggested Pool is a corruption of Pill, which is suggested as meaning "Stream": both seem less likely). For example, for the above translated 
location "Hunger Pill" the original has <I>pull neuynn</I> (i.e. in modern Welsh 
<I>Pwll Newyn</I>, "Hunger Pool").
Although Davies<A href="../../references/Davies1990Mathern.html" target=bottom>*</A> suggests 
the old name of St. Pierre's Pill was <I>Porthiscoed</I> ("harbour below the woods"), wherehence 
<I><A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-2.72080&GridN=51.59320&lon=-2.72080&lat=51.59320&search_result=Portskewett%2CMonmouthshire&db=freegaz&cidr_client=none&lang=&place=Portskewett,Monmouthshire&pc=&advanced=&client=public&addr2=&quicksearch=Portskewett&addr3=&scale=100000&addr1=" target=_new class=place>Portskewett</A></I>, 
evidence for this is far less forthcoming and it doesn't seem likely Portskewett was associated 
with the Meurig brook.
</P>






<P>
Jones<A href="../../references/Jones1954Wells.html">*</A>, while discussing St.Tewdric's well, 
gives the location of "Pwll <I>Meurig</I>", 
as being "a short distance to the west" of the well (which Pwll<I>meyric</I> village 
certainly isn't). This may be the pool referred to by the 
local in this <A href="pwllmeyric.html" target=bottom>Note</A>, however, it 
seems unlikely that the inlet is being discussed 
as this would have pre-dated Jones and the local described the site as a pool. 
</P>
<P>
There are two pools in Mathern: one is associated with 
a Spring 500m east of the village and is now on the edge of an industrial estate. While it 
is shown on the 1886 map, and therefore older than the estate, 
it may also be associated with drainage ditching of an indeterminate age. Had the Severn 
risen as far as this pool at this time (and it did at some 
time<A href="../../references/Cadw2002Gwent.html" target=bottom>*</A>), 
it is unlikely (but still possible) Hunger Pill would have existed, 
which causes some problems if we believe the Llan D&#226;v boundary (above) to have been  
laid down, at least geographically, by Meurig (it seems unlikely "Pull Muric" as a name 
would have existed before he gave the area to Llan D&#226;v). 
</P>
<P>
The second pool is just west of the church in the grounds of the Palace of the Bishops of 
Llan D&#226;v  
(see <A href="../mathern.html" target=right>Visit Details</A>).  
This pond may or may not be shown on the 1886 map -  
though there is something there, it is under writing and hard to discern. 
It is possible that the feature referred to by Jones and the local is this pond. The fact that the 
remains of the palace of the Bishops of Llan D&#226;v (on the land granted to them by 
Meurig) are in the same location 
doesn't negate the pond being older, but there is no evidence for this. Equally, there is no 
evidence the pond carried a name of any sort, and the evidence more strongly 
points to the inlet being Pwll Mouric.
