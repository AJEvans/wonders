Pwllmeyric would seem like an obvious location for this wonder, 
however, the topography is completely wrong. The village is 
on the side of a valley, much of it 30m above sealevel (though the 
grounds of the local manor "Pwll Meyric House" may once have 
extended down to the Wye?). 
There is also no sign of the pool (<I>pwll</I>) - or a well 
dedicated to Meyric which is rumoured to have existed.  
While the manor groundsmen suggest  
that springs have been coming and going on the 
Wye side of the manor as long as anyone could remember, 
one local, when asked, suggested the pool used to be 
down passed
