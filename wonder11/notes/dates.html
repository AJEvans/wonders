The Life of St.Oudoceus 
(<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/oudoceus.html" target=_new>Translation</A>) from the Book of Llan D&#226;v (see 
<A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>) makes 
Mouric a contemporary of Oudoceus and the Yellow Plague of Britain. 
The latter is dated to 547 <SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN> by the <I>Annales Cambriae</I> (see 
<A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>). Plainly, 
though, Saints' lives vary tremendously in how much faith one would put in them.
</P>
<P>
The genealogy for the kings of Gwent exists in 
three slightly different forms in three separate 
manuscripts<A href="../../references/Kirby1976Dynastic.html" target=bottom>*</A>. The oldest, which is found attached 
to the <I>Historia</I>'s Harleian 3859 Manuscript (Manuscript <A href="../../history/manuscripts.html#A" target=right>A</A>), gives 
(with dates from Kirby<A href="../../references/Kirby1976Dynastic.html" target=bottom>*</A>):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>...Teudubric - Mouric - Atoys - Morcant - Iudhail&nbsp;[alive&nbsp;716-757] -&nbsp;Fernmail&nbsp;[d.775] -&nbsp;Atroys 
-&nbsp;Iudhail&nbsp;[d.848]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
(NB1: Note that the date at the end of this matches a date for the compilation of the <I>Historia</I> of 830 
if it is assumed Iudhail [Ithel] was alive when added to the end of the genealogy 
[See <A href="../../introduction/notes/date.html" target=bottom>Dating Note</A>]; note also the consistent spelling 
of Mouric both in the Wonder and the genealogy [See <A href="alternatives.html" target=bottom>Alternatives Note</A>]. NB2: 
Some have suggested that Atoys [Adroes/Athrawes in the other manuscripts / Athrwys in the Book of Llan D&#226;v (See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>)] is the legendary Arthur, though the evidence is limited).

The other two genealogies include an earlier Meuric/Meurig, at least five generations before Tewdric. This is unlikely 
to be our Meuric if the Wonder refers to Mathern, as it is plain that the Book of Llan D&#226;v, 
at least, places Tewdric's son who handed over the land at ~550 <SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN> : both the Meurig that welcomes 
Oudoceus to his land in ~550 and Tewdric's son are married to a woman called Onbrawst, connecting the Oudoceus date to the period of the 
land gift by Tewdric's son. Davies<A href="../../references/Davies1979Charters.html">*</A> notes that Meurig is recorded as the 
son of Enynny [Henfyn/Enhinti] in the Harleian manuscript 2414(fo.59v) and the Life of St.Cadoci. 
Enynny was the sister of Urien Rheged (<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urien_Rheged" target=_new>Info</A>), 
which would put Meurig in the 6th C., however the Jesus College manuscript 20(9) gives this mother to 
the earlier Meurig so there is some confusion<A href="../../references/Davies1979Charters.html">*</A>. There were also at least two other king Meurigs 
in the area much later, reigning c.848-874 (Meurig ap Arthfael) and c.1035-1065 (Meurig ap Hywel)<A href="../../references/Davies1979Charters.html">*</A>. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming the standard 30 years per generation, the genealogy above gives Tewdric as alive between c.596 and 637, and Mouric 
as alive between 626 and 667. On the basis of the same assumption and the dating implicit in the 
Book of Llan D&#226;v Davies suggests c.555-625 and c.585-665 respectively<A href="../../references/Davies1979Charters.html">*</A>. 
Neither estimates for Mouric obviously match the date for the Yellow Plague of 547.

Other Suggested dates for Tewdric's death range from 470 <SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>, which 
Thomas<A href="../../references/Thomas2004Sacred.html">*</A> 
suggests is given as the date on a plaque at Tewdrick's well 
(The plaque couldn't be found in 2005: see 
<A href="../pwllmeyric.html" target=right>Visit Details</A>) 
to 610 <SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../../references/Catholic2003Tewdrig.html">*</A>.

As a footnote, genealogies in the 12th C. Life of St. Cadog<A href="../../references/WadeEvans1944Vitae.html" target=bottom>*</A> tie 
this family to the family of Cunedda Wledig (and therefore, somewhat dubiously, Arthur), as well as the mythical 
forefathers/mothers of the British/Welsh rulers. For more details see the 
<A href="../../wonder13/myth.html" target=right>genealogy of Arthur's sons</A> from 
the <A href="../../wonder13/index.html" target=right>Wonder&nbsp;13</A> pages, plus this 
<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/cadog.html" target=_new>English Translation</A> of the Life.
