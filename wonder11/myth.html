Saint Meurig (Maurice), son of Saint Tewdric (or Tewdrig), was the king of Glamorgan (and Gwent?) sometime between the 
mid-500s and 700 <SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><SUP><A href="notes/dates.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>. 
According to the Book of Llan D&#226;v<SUP><A href="notes/transdav.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP> (see 
<A href="../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>)
Tewdric gave the crown to his son and 
retired to Dindyrn 
(<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?GridE=-2.68360&GridN=51.70340&client=public&lon=-2.68360&lat=51.70340&place=Tintern+Parva,Monmouthshire&db=freegaz&local=&type=&start=&limit=&overviewmap=&scale=100000&search_result=Tintern%20Parva%2CMonmouthshire&lang=&db=freegaz" class=place target=_new>Tintern</A>) 
as a recluse after a lifetime as an undefeated 
warrior.

However, the Saxons threatened to invade and take his son's territory, 
so Tewdric took to the battlefield one last time, assured by an angel of 
the lord that he would die, but die victorious. 
This came to pass, and the old king was wounded, however he refused 
to die until Christ took him to the Isle of <I>Echni</I> 
(<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=340000.49652383&Y=170000.408191391&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=200000&left.x=7&left.y=94" target=_new class=place>Flat Holm 
Island</A>?<A href="../references/Utting1998Tewdric.html" target=bottom>*</A><A href="../references/Davies1990Mathern.html" target=bottom>*</A>) to 
be buried. 
Duely, the next morning, two stags yoked to a carriage appeared 
and bore him towards the Severn<SUP><A href="notes/stags.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP>. At a meadow near the river the 
carriage broke and a clear spring flowed (though it is not clear whether 
this was because of Tewdric or was there before). He ordered the stags away and expired.
His son then had built there a prayer-house and cemetery, which he 
then gave, along with the whole area, to the church of Llan D&#226;v 
(<A href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09315c.htm" target=_new>History</A>) - or so <I>they</I> say...
</P>
<P>
The spring is universally believed to be St.Tewdric's Well in 
Mathern, while the church is held to be St.Theodorick's (a latinization of 
Tewdric[k]), again in Mathern, next to the palace of the Bishops of Llan D&#226;v.
