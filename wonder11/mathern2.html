Back at the church, walk towards the village, 
and a minute's stroll round the corner you will find Tewdric's Well on the 
left (<A href="photos/mathern-well.html" class=photo>Photo</A>). 
Peering over the fence to the back of it, you 
can look down the stream you walked along a short while 
ago (<A href="photos/mathern-valley-vr.html" class=photo>VR View</A>). This stream 
(when it flows) rises just behind the conifers next to the well. There is, conveniently, some wood over 
it (<A href="photos/mathern-spring.html" class=photo>Photo</A>), however, this is unlikely to 
be the original spring, as the gully it starts in is 
too deep, and the most detailed Ordnance Survey maps show it as a resurgence 
of a spring further up the hill. 
</P>
<P>
It has also to be noted 
that the well itself doesn't entirely "run clear" - indeed, 
if Tewdric stopped there for a rest now the smell 
would probably have him pushing up daisys.
