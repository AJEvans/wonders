<P>
Meurig may have<SUP><A href="notes/sources.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP> married off several of 
his daughters to the sons of king Emyr Llydaw from Armorica, who left their homeland 
to settle in Glamorganshire after 
the usurpation of the crown by one of their brothers<A href="../references/Bryce1990Lives.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
These marriages are said to have produced many of 
the early Welsh saints, making Meurig's family one of the great centres 
of Welsh church mythology<A href="../references/Bryce1990Lives.html" target=bottom>*</A>.

<P>
As an afternote: Miles Salley, one of the Bishops 
(1500-1517 <SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../references/Catholic2003Llandav.html" target=bottom>*</A>) buried in the 
church, left instructions to have his heart buried next to Tewdric<A href="../references/Davies1990Mathern.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
When Bishop Godwin had the grave at the high altar of the church 
opened in 1610 a stone coffin 
and an urn, said to contain the heart, were found<A href="../references/Davies1990Mathern.html" target=bottom>*</A>. Godwin wrote in 1614 
"I discovered his [Tewdric's] bones...the skull retaining the aperture of a large 
wound which appeared as if it had been recently inflicted."<A href="../references/Utting1998Tewdric.html" target=bottom>*</A> The remains 
were reburied, only to be re-exhumed and re-interned in 1881 during the restoration of the church<A href="../references/Davies1990Mathern.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
