If you come along the A48 road leading to or from the old Severn
bridge, your first stop will be Pwllmeyric, which is 
just off this road on the A466. While the grounds of the local manor, 
Pwll Meyric House, are private land you can 
look over them by stopping  
at the northern end of the village by the gatehouse 
(<A href="photos/pwllmeyric-sign.html" class=photo>Photo</A>) 
and looking across the fields towards the Wye 
(<A href="photos/pwllmeyric-field.html" class=photo>Photo</A>). It should 
be quite apparent that the location is far too high to be part of our story.

Continuing along the A466 west out of Pwllmeyric, you need to turn 
south immediately after the town on a 'blink and you miss it' 
minor road through some meadows. This will take you to 
Mathern.
