"There is another wonderful thing in the above oft-mentioned region of Guent.  There is there a spring 
near to the wall of the well of Mouric, and timber in the middle of the spring, and men wash their 
hands together with their faces, and they have the timber beneath their feet when they wash - for 
instance I have both tried and seen it. When it is inundated by the sea, until the worst the 
Severn is extended over everything coastal, and covers, and all the way to the spring it is 
stretched out, and the spring is filled from the teared Severn, and draws the wood with itself 
all the way to the great sea, and throughout the space of three days on the sea it is 
turned upside-down, and on day four, in the above mentioned spring, it is found. It is 
also a fact that one  from the countryside might have buried it in the earth to require 
it proved, and on day four it was found in the spring and the former rustic, he who 
concealed and buried it, was dead before the end of the 
month."<SUP><A href="notes/translation.html" target=bottom>1</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/alternatives.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>

This wonder - an inlet with well, a spring where people washed, and a returning plank - is likely to have 
been at <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=352500&Y=191000&width=500&height=300&gride=352392&gridn=190946&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=pc&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=NP166JA&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=1&scale=25000" 
target=_new class=place>Mathern</A><SUP><A href="notes/location.html" target=bottom>3</A>,</SUP>, a small village near the junction of the Wye and Severn, close to <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=360000.750714328&Y=190000.317123833&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=100000&left.x=6&left.y=95" target=_new class=place>Pwllmeyric</A><SUP><A href="notes/pwllmeyric.html" target=bottom>4</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/guardian.html" target=bottom>5</A></SUP>. 
Mathern is associated with the south-eastern Welsh king Meyric, or Meurig, and was by an inlet in 
the past (<A href="map.html" class=place>Map</A> and 
<A href="http://www.mostlymaps.com/images/10298.jpg" target=_new>Engraving</A><A href="../references/Gastineau1829Prints.html" target=bottom>*</A> from early 1880s</A> - note the water by the church)<SUP><A href="notes/pwll.html" target=bottom>6</A>,</SUP>. However, the village well is currently dedicated to Meurig's father, St.Tewdric.
