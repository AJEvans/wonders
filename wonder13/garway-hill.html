Garway Hill common must offer one of the best viewpoints in the whole of the Welsh borderlands 
(<A href="photos/garway-tvmast.html" target=right>Photo</A>; <A href="photos/garway-mound2.html" target=right>Photo</A>), so it's strange  
not to find it inundated with burial mounds, particularly given the presence on its slopes of 
what may or may not be ancient earthworks<A href="../references/White1988Earthworks.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
However, one suspects that part of the problem is that there's been so 
much activity on the hilltop, that it would be hard to determine what was or was not ancient. 
For example, at the top of the hill are the brick remains of a World War Two radio 
tower<A href="../references/Roseff2005Tower.html" target=bottom>*</A>. Around it is what certainly looks like the dug out remains of a tumulus 
(<A href="photos/garway-mound1.html" target=right>Photo</A>; <A href="photos/garway-tower.html" target=right>Photo</A>), but it is almost impossible to know 
given the recent construction activity. Equally, there are other mounds and earthworks on the 
common top. Almost all the Ordnance Survey maps up to the modern era show a variety of circles towards the top of the hill, all in 
different places, and all of which are ambiguous. Here are some photos of one potential mound/spring combination, which is half way between the mast 
and the hilltop:

<A href="photos/garway-spring3.html" target=right>Photo</A>; <A href="photos/garway-spring4.html" target=right>Photo</A>, plus a few other lumps 
and bumps in the same area: <A href="photos/garway-lumps.html" target=right>Photo</A> - though it should be noted that there 
was a lot of work in this area associated with the radio-tower<A href="../references/Roseff2005Tower.html" target=bottom>*</A>.

The most likely candidate for our wonder, however, is a slight rise near the  
<a href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&amp;X=343000&amp;Y=225000&amp;width=500&amp;height=300&amp;gride=349060.998578357&amp;gridn=230407.415910424&amp;srec=0&amp;coordsys=gb&amp;db=freegaz&amp;addr1=&amp;addr2=&amp;addr3=&amp;pc=&amp;advanced=&amp;local=&amp;localinfosel=&amp;kw=&amp;inmap=&amp;table=&amp;ovtype=&amp;keepicon=true&amp;zm=0&amp;scale=25000&amp;right.x=512&amp;right.y=163" target="_new" class="place">TV mast</a>  
(<A href="photos/garway-mast1.html">Photo</A>; <A href="photos/garway-mast2.html" target=right>Photo</A>). While this 
appears natural, at least 
two archaeological groups<a href="../references/Brown1994Garway.html" target="bottom">*</a><a href="../references/Olding2000Easternblack.html" target="bottom">*</a>  
have suggested it is a neolithic burial 
mound<SUP><A href="notes/garway-location.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>.  Olding 
gives its dimensions as 30m by 16m by 2m high<a href="../references/Olding2000Easternblack.html" target="bottom">*</a>, much larger than the description in the 
<I>Historia</I>. There are at least two 
springs mapped out on Ordnance Survey sheets within 200m of the feature on the Garron side of the common, and the one just to the west is marked on the 1st OS maps 
of the area (mapped some time in the second half of the 1800s). However, the whole area is generally leaking water to the head of the Garron, 
which is just below the common here, and there are at least 10 other suitable springs within a few hundred metres, including that 
shown in the photos above, which is not marked on the map but is undoubtably the closest.
