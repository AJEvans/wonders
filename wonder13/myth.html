The lineage and descendants of Arthur is an area wrought with 
difficulties: patriotic (people want to show he was a real person); 
empowered (people want to show they are descended from him<A href="../../references/Kirby1976Dynastic.html" target=bottom>*</A>);
political (people want to show he was from their area); 
and finally poetic (everyone has a different Arthur). Different 
genealogies have been offered for him by different set of writers: 
the early mediaeval; the Normans; the later Romantics. Much of the field 
is distorted by the works of Geoffrey of Monmouth 
(See <A href="../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>) 
who probably did some heavy-handed editing and interpolation from earlier sources.

Attached to one Welsh version of Geoffrey's "History of the Kings of Britain" 
is a genealogy which seems to insert Arthur, on his 
father's side, into the kingship of Cornwall/Devon<SUP><A href="notes/dumnonian.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP> 
(the Mostyn Manuscript 177 genealogies; late 13th C.). The names on this are 
in Welsh, though it is unclear if this is copied from an earlier source or 
not<SUP><A href="notes/mostyn.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP> . On 
his mother's side, much of the information comes from a separate manuscript 
(Vitellius C.IX). More generally, it is usually accepted that information 
found in tales from Wales, Cornwall and Brittany that have older linguistic 
traits and that contain information not found in Geoffrey are drawn from 
an older and more reliable tradition<SUP><A href="notes/demetia.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP>.

Given all this, here's the <A href="genealogy/index.html">lineage of Anir</A>. Special mention 
is particularly due to the work of Bromwich<A href="../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
in the construction of this.
