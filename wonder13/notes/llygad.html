<I>Licat</I> is almost certainly the current Welsh <I>Llygad</I> ("Eye"). This is made explicit by the scribe of  
manuscript <A href="../../history/manuscripts.html#E" target=right>E</A> 
who translates the name to <I>Oculus Amirmur</I><A href="../../references/Stevenson1838Nennius.html">*</A>. 

During the 10th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN> the Welsh <i>LL</i> changed in pronounciation 
from <i>L</i> to the current <i>LTH</i><a href="../../references/Griffen1994Names.html">*</a> possibly suggesting 
the wonder was dictated prior to then (see also <A href="../../wonder6/index.html" target=right>Linn Liuan</A>). 
Examples of dictation and transcription errors can be found in classic Welsh texts, for example, 
<i>Culhwch ac Olwen</i> (<a href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html">*</a> page xvi), so 
we should be little surprised to find them here, though we await Vol.10 of Dumville's <i>The Historia Brittonum</i> 
(see <a href="../../history/translations.html" target="right">Translations</a>) which he 
notes<a href="../../references/Dumville1986Value.html">*</a> will contain a full study by K.H.Jackson of the Welsh language forms.

This Welsh term is still used in placenames in Wales to refer to 
springs. More specifically Jones<a href="../../references/Jones1954Wells.html" target=bottom>*</a> (p.1-3) suggests there is 
a distinction between standard springs which are called <i>ffynnon</i> (a "spring-pool"), 
<i>tarddiant</i> (an "eruption"), 
<i>gofer</i> ("overflow"),
or <i>pistyll</i> ("spout" - also "waterfall") and springs that are at the source of rivers, which tend to 
be named <i>llygad</i> ("eye"), 
<i>blaen</i> ("top") 
or <i>codiad</i> ("rising") - though in the case of holy wells named <i>Ffynnon llygad</i>, of which there 
are several in Wales, the name tends to point to their being held as curing eye-diseases<a href="../../references/Jones1954Wells.html" target=bottom>*</a>.
The term "eye" is used more generally in English to refer to the main spring point in any spring pool 
(e.g. see Thomas<A href="../../references/Thomas2004Sacred.html" target=bottom>*</A>).
