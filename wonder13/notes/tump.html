The burial mound at Wormelow Tump was of sufficient interest to give the Village its name 
(see this <A href="wormelow.html" target=bottom>Note</A> for details of its importance).

A "Tump" is a Tumulus/Round Barrow/Burial Mound (though see <A href="other.html">Note</A> on Cole's Tump). 
The origins of the word are unclear, possibly relating (as in Tumulus) 
to the Latin <I>tumere</I> "to swell" (indeed, this link may account for the legend of the changing sizes of both <A href="../../wonder13/index.html" target=right>Wonder&nbsp;13</A> and <A href="../../wonder14/index.html" target=right>Wonder&nbsp;14</A>). There is certainly an old Welsh flavour about the word : 
Webster's 1913, for example, giving its origins as the <Q>W[elsh] twmp, twm, a round mass or heap, a hillock</Q>   
(c.f. current Welsh <I>Twmpath</I>). The O.E.D. 
places its earliest known use in 1589, suggesting the Welsh could have picked it up from English or Latin. 
However, the Welsh title of the triad the "Three pack-horses of the Island of Britain" is 
"Tri Thom Edystyr Prydein", and Bromwich suggests <I>Thom</I> (<I>Tom</I>;<I>Tomen</I>) is mound, heap or burden, 
apparently appearing in the early Welsh Laws (see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>) 
and the <I>Llywarch Hen</I> cycle of poems as such<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>.   
It may ultimately relate to the  
Greek for sepulchral mound, <I>&tau;&uacute;&mu;&beta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</I>, from wherehence the  English "tomb" - 
though the earliest English usage given by the O.E.D. draws an explicit contrast between tombs and tumps.

<P>
The <I>Low</I> part is a corruption of the Old English <i>Hla</i>(<i>e</i>)<i>w</i>
which usually refers to mounds as well<A href="../../references/Cromarty2003Documents.html">*</A> (see this 
<A href="wormelow.html" target=bottom>Note</A>). Such pleonastic names are not uncommon in Britain: the 
classic example being <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-3.24040&GridN=54.74690&lon=-3.24040&lat=54.74690&search_result=Torpenhow%2CCumbria&db=freegaz&lang=&keepicon=true&place=Torpenhow,Cumbria&pc=&advanced=&client=public&addr2=&quicksearch=torpenhow&addr3=&scale=100000&addr1=" class=place target=_new>Torpenhow</A>, which contains three different terms commonly used 
for hills.
</P>
<P>Finally, <I>Worm</I> is apparently(?) from the Old English for 'dusky'<A href="../../references/Hereford2005Saxon.html">*</A> 
and is the name of a local brook 
(it is listed in the Liber Llan D&#226;v 
[See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>] as the <I>Guormui</I>, which might be open to other 
interpretations).
