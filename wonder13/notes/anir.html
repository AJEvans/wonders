<P>
Of more difficulty is the name of the son. Manuscript <A href="../../history/manuscripts.html#H" target=right>H</A> 
gives us <I>Amr</I>, while Manuscript <A href="../../history/manuscripts.html#A" target=right>A</A>, 
which is likely to be the oldest, 
gives us <I>Anir</I>, either of which we might assume to be a mis-transcription of the other, 
however, manuscript <A href="../../history/manuscripts.html#E" target=right>E</A> gives us 
<I>Amir</I>, mixing the two spellings. 
</P>
<P>The only other mention of this son comes from the mediaeval Welsh "Mabinogion" tale <I>Gereint</I> in 
which the son is named as <I>Amhar</I>. This is similar to "Gamber" if we assume some mis-transcription or 
evolution, however, this reference seems to have led most translators/scribers to give the name as <I>Amr</I>, presumably 
under the assumption that the <I>Historia</I> manuscript variations are mis-transcriptions of the letter "m" 
(though on this criteria one might equally suppose the original name <I>Anihar</I> or <I>Anibar</I>). 
</P>
<P>
<I>Amr</I> is to a certain extent backed up by the name "Gamber" and the fact that 
Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council note that the Welsh name for the Gamber 
is <I>Afon&nbsp;Amr</I><A href="../../references/Anon2004Gwent.html">*</A> (though other evidence for this river 
name remains elusive). 
<I>Amr</I> certainly appears as a name constituent, for example in the name of 
Arthurian hero Bedwyr's son <I>Amren</I>, mentioned at the same time as <I>Amhar</I> in <I>Gereint</I> but also 
mentioned in in the court list and as fighting the Black Hag in <I>Culhwch ac Olwen</I> 
(see <A href="../../twrch/myth.html" target=right>here</A> for more about this story). One might suppose 
the two characters to once have been one, but there is no evidence for it - they may simply have 
been tied together because of the sound of their names. 
</P>
In <I>Gereint</I> we find out Amr and Amren were two of the four squire-chamberlains who guarded Arthur's bed. 
Some have speculated that this indicates a lack of favour, and possibly that Amr was illegitimate. 
Given the complex systems of kinship and guardianship which were in place in Dark Age Wales 
it seems a speculation too far - particularly given that the position was also occupied by Arthur's  
friend's son. That said, the killing of Amr by Arthur noted in the <I>Historia</I> 
does have a linguistic resonance if the name is, in fact, <I>Amhir</I>, as this term 
tends to start Welsh words associated with disrespect, rash abuse, and woe.
<P>
Equally, however, it is possible the name of the spring came before the Arthurian myth was attached to 
it. <I>Amr</I> is part of some words associated with eyelids (<I>Amrant</I>) - though more generally <I>Am</I> tends to act like the 
English "un-" or "en-", as, for example, in "encircle": <I>amgylchu</i> (cf. <I>cylchu</I> "circle"). 
On a completely different tack, Stevenson notes that Sir S. Meyrick suggested the original was actually 
<I>Llygyd Aur</I> "Golden Eye"<A href="../../references/Stevenson1838Nennius.html">*</A>. 
</P>
<P>
One might also note the rock <I>Main-Amber</I> [<I>Maen</I> "Rock": "Rock of Amber"] 
referred to by 
Camden<A href="../../references/Camden1607Britannia.html" target=bottom>*</A>(<A href="http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/cornwalleng.html#cornwall9" target=_new>Cornwall</A>). This rocking-rock 
was apparently destroyed by an over-zealous iconoclast in the 
Civil War<A href="../../references/Hunt1903Popular.html" target=bottom>*</A> (though it  
may have been a natural feature it obviously attracted visitors). 
Hunt<A href="../../references/Hunt1903Popular.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(<A href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/prwe/prwe067.htm" target=_new>online</A>) quotes 
C. S Gilbert's <I>An Historical Survey of Cornwall</I> (1817) in suggesting 
 that the name relates to the Cornish for "anointed" or "consecrated", though evidence for this is not forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
In fact, <I>Anir</I> itself 
is actually a perfectly decent word in Welsh. Though its meaning of "old" or 
"(age?-)shortened"<A href="../../references/UW2002Geiriadur.html" target=bottom>*</A> doesn't particularly make 
sense in the context of the Arthurian story, there are springs in Wales named <I>Hen</I> - again meaning "old" 
(one, for example, was used as the boundary of the Dark Age kingdom of Gwynlliog in South Wales [see the 
<A href="http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celtic/ctexts/cadog.html" target=_new>Life of St.Cadog</A>]). If the original 
name of the spring was "Old Spring", it would be very old indeed.
