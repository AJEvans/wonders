(<a href="../photos/gamber-head.html" target=right>Photo</a>). However, the Isaac Taylor 
<a href="wormelow-taylor-map.html" target=right>map</a> of 1754 shows the stream crossing the 
road and issuing from "Gamber Spring" about 100m south-west of the main Wormelow crossroads, possibly at the 
site of a current pond, but definitely a good deal closer 
than now (in fact, the OS mark the currently accepted spring as a well, and the actual issue 50m or so further north 
along a drainage ditch, however, the accepted 'spring' is certainly the strongest point of issue).
