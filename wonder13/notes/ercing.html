The Anglo-Saxon Chronicals (See 
<A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>) 
has Archenfield as <I>Iercingafelda</I> 
(<A href="http://www.georgetown.edu/labyrinth/library/oe/texts/asc/a.html#ad914" target=_new>914</A>: 
<I>Yrcingafelda</I> in the Abingdon version), leading Napier 
to suggest a derivation from the Anglo-Saxon <I>Inga-</I><A href="../../references/Bevan1896Survey.html" target=bottom>*</A>.

However, the book of Llan D&#226;v 
(See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>) 
has the following variants of "Archenfield" which show the range and evolution nicely:  
<I>Ergin</I>; 
<I>Ergic</I>; 
<I>Ercinecg</I>; 
<I>Ercycg</I>;
<I>Erchin</I>; 
<I>Eirgin</I>; 
<I>Ercic</I>; 
<I>Ercicg</I>;
<I>Ercychi</I>;  
<I>Ercig</I>; 
<I>Erging</I>; 
<I>Erchyng</I>; 
<I>Urcenevelde</I>; 
<I>Erchynfeld</I><A href="../../references/Evans1893Llandav.html" target=bottom>*</A>. The ultimate source of the name may (or may not) 
be linked to the local Roman location <I>Ariconium</I> 
mentioned in the 
Antonine Itinerary (See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" 
target=right>Other Works</A>). For example 
Camden<a href="../../references/Camden1607Britannia.html" target="bottom">*</a> [<a href="http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/hertseng.html#herts1" target="_new">Herefordshire</a>] 
gives us...

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Country which wee call Herefordshire,  and the Britains named Eirenuc</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>How farre that little region Arcenfeld reached I know not, but the affinity betweene these names Ereinuc, Arcenfeld, the town Ariconium, of which Antonine in the description of this tract maketh mention, and Hareford or Hereford, which is now the chiefe City of the Shire, have by little and little induced me to this opinion, that I thinke every one of these was derived from Ariconium. Yet doe I not thinke that Ariconium and Hereford were both one and the same...</BLOCKQUOTE>

Archenfield ("Arcenefeld(e)") is denoted in the 
Domesday Book as including the following areas (modern names, except where unknown "?"): 
Garway; [Ballingham]; [Harewood near Llanwarne]; Kilpeck; Baysham; Kings Caple; Pontrilas; Ashe Ingen; Little and Much Birch; Penebecdoc(?); Godrich; the Wormelow Hundred (including Westwood; St.Peter; Dewsall); the Hezetre(?) Hundred (including Burlingjobb; Old Radnor;); the Elson Hundred (including Whitney; Mateurdin(?); Eardisley; Chickward) Elsdon hundred (including  Woonton); the Plegelgete(?) Hundred (including Rowden); and the Bromsash Hundred (including  Newarne(?); Redbrook(?) Staunton; Yatton)<A href="../../references/PRO1085Domesday.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its special 
location between the Saxon and British areas Archenfield seems to 
have gained and/or maintained some unusual laws 
and customs<A href="../../references/PRO1085Domesday.html" target=bottom>*</A> (<A href="http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/HEF/Hentland/History1876.html" target=_new>Info</A>). Some of these related to its role as official corridor between the two countries, and 
some related to its keeping Saxon and apparently Welsh-only laws.
