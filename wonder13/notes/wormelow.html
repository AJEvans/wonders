The chief reasons for suggesting Wormelow Tump as the site are 
circumstantial. While name of the River Gamber and the location of Gamber Head are 
indicative (see <A href="anir.html" target=bottom>Note</A>), it is chiefly 
the place of Wormelow Tump at the centre of the communities in this area 
that marks it out as a potential location.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, it should be noted that the current residents of the village believe it 
to be the location of the tomb - there is a small display in the "Wormelow Tump Inn". 
This is not to be dismissed, as there has been broad community continuity in this area, 
albeit under different management, since recorded history began in the region. While,  it 
seems very likely this reflects recent Arthurian worker's opinions rather than a native tradition, 
its hard to be definite.
<P>
The chief reason Wormelow Tump is historically recorded at all is its place 
as the long-term centre of the social structure in this area. 
Wormelow (<I>Urmelauia</I>) is recorded in the Domesday Book as being the meeting place of the 
Hundred (or possibly Shire) Court, to which any (free man?) with a horse in Hereford had to go three 
times a year<A href="../../references/PRO1085Domesday.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
The court system certainly appears inherited from the period of Saxon rule and 
the name "Wormelow" is composed of Old English/Anglo-Saxon terms, backing up its importance to 
the Saxons. The Old English term <I>Hla</I>(<I>e</I>)<I>w</I>, which has now 
corrupted in placenames to the "Low" component<A href="../../references/Cromarty2003Documents.html" target=bottom>*</A>, indicates a mound - so it is likely the tump was there 
during Saxon times at least (see <A href="tump.html">Note</A> on name). 
</P>
<P>
However, this is not to say it was any older - the picture is confused by the fact that the 
Anglo-Saxons were known to build their own mounds to meet at, but also to reuse 
old burial mounds for the purpose (in addition, they were also known to 
reuse older mounds to bury their dead)<A href="../../references/Cromarty2003Documents.html" target=bottom>*</A>. It should be noted that there has been at least one suggestion that 
<I>Hlaw</I> referred specifically to either mounds reused for burial or new Anglo-Saxon 
burial mounds, 
while <I>beor&#541;</I> ["bergh"] <!-beorg-> 
(related to <I>hearg</I><A href="../../references/Turner2000Danelaw.html" target=bottom>*</A>?) 
referred  to older untouched burial mounds<A href="../../references/Cromarty2003Documents.html" target=bottom>*</A>. This may point to 
Anglo-Saxon remains/contamination at least at Wormelow (thought the name 
split may have a north-south divide as well<A href="../../references/Turner2000Danelaw.html" target=bottom>*</A>).
While there doesn't appear to have been an archeological investigation prior to the mound's destruction, 
Andere<A href="../../references/Andere1995Arthurian.html" target=bottom>*</A> notes that

<BLOCKQUOTE>An elderly gentleman who had heard I was interested in trying to trace whether the Tump had ever been excavated, kindly 
phoned and informed me that when, in 1885, as a trial test before attempting excavation (an attempt subsequently 
 not made), a two-pole section was taken through the mound at mid-height, nothing was found. Finally a vertical was attempted, but nothing was discovered, apart from a few bones and some ashes. I asked if the ashes were in an urn or any other sort of vessel, but he could not sat, nor what had happened 
to them after that.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
As it is not clear whether the Saxons used their own meeting places as burial mounds 
this doesn't give us much to go on either way, other than to confirm that the mound was one 
of the relatively rare (1 in 12<A href="../../references/Turner2000Danelaw.html" target=bottom>*</A>) Anglo-Saxon meeting mounds that were also 
burial mounds. 


If it did turn out the tump at Wormelow was Anglo-Saxon, it is of interest that  
the meeting-function isn't noted (unless the measurement reference is 
meant humorously!) and the fact that 
it is in Anglo-Saxon territory isn't mentioned - which it is for other wonders in the list. 
The general fact that the Saxons aren't mentioned suggests the list dates from 
prior to the Saxon incursion into this area, though there was a good deal of fluctuation in control of 
this region.
</P>
<P>
It is likely that Anglo-Saxon meetings in general in Britain go back <I>at least</I> to the early 
9th C.<A href="../../references/Turner2000Danelaw.html" target=bottom>*</A>, but, 
of course, it is possible the meetings at Wormelow also extended further back 
(the name and location may suggest at least a pre-10th C. Saxon use<A href="../../references/Turner2000Danelaw.html" target=bottom>*</A>).  
The fact that the location was positioned at the rural junction of five roads (plus two  
minor tracks), and not in 
the major town of the area, says something about the power structures in place 
when it was set up - while these certainly appear to be the Hundred system 
of the Saxons, it is not clear what prior system was in place. 
The Domesday book makes it quite apparent that this was a rare legal location, in which Saxon 
law continued in the presence of Norman/French rule but with particular rules 
for the Welsh in the area<A href="../../references/PRO1085Domesday.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
More work would be needed on the layout of the road system in the area and its 
interrelation with the mound and surrounding villages of various ages before anything 
definitive could be said. However, one thing is clear - the tremendous continuity of 
form in this area. Not only is Wormelow still a major junction in the local 
road network, but it still 
represents the junction between a number of administrative units (three census wards and 
three parishes), just as the 
meeting place probably did for the Saxons<A href="../../references/Turner2000Danelaw.html" target=bottom>*</A>.  
In addition, within Wormelow itself, the area of the meeting place <I>may</I> have 
been preserved by the village form (see <A href="destroyed.html" target=bottom>Note</A> on tump location).
</P>
<P>
Thin reasoning though the importance of Wormelow Tump is, it does indicate that 
this, of all the possible locations within the area, has held an unusually significant importance for 
the local people. For that reason alone it deserves some consideration.
