This is not especially unreasonable. A good many early references place Arthur in Devon/Cornwall. 
The earliest probable reference to him, in the Gododdin (See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>), 
seems to place him in a Northern British literature, however, one should remember that Gereint 
(possibly the Devonian Arthurian character, though see Pearce<A href="../../references/Pearce1971Traditions.html" target=bottom>*</A>), who also appears in the poem, is there "for the South". This suggests that, 
if the poem is a real reflection of the group, the Gododdin warband was made up from those across the British nation and would have access to 
a broad range of cultural role-models. For a detailed discussion of the movement of the people in the genealogy, see 
Pearce<A href="../../references/Pearce1971Traditions.html" target=bottom>*</A><A href="../../references/Pearce1974Cornish.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
