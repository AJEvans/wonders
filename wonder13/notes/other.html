Of course, this is not to say these are the only possibilities. 
In general the position of the tomb near a spring isn't a terribly helpful identifier, 
as it seems this is reasonably common. Jones<A href="../../references/Jones1954Wells.html">*</A> (p.14,26 and 
throughout)
quotes a large number of tumuli and uncovered dolmen near springs regarded, at least in later periods, as 
holy, and gives references and examples suggesting springs were sacred prior to the christian period. This is also commented on by Field<A href="../../references/Field1999Bury.html">*</A> (see also this <A href="age.html" target=bottom>Note</A> on the age of Wormelow Tump</A>; 
it is not apparent what level of statistical investigation has been completed on this relationship).  
</P>
<P>While the name "Gamber Head" is indicative (see <A href="anir.html">Note</A>), even within the 
area around the spring there is another village called 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=349000&Y=230000&width=500&height=300&gride=349060.998578357&gridn=230407.415910424&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&downright.x=512&downright.y=323" target=_new class=place>Turkey Tump</A>, suggesting an alternative 
site (in fact it is not a great deal further from the Spring than Wormelow Tump). However, no map shows a tumulus there (though there is 
a late chapel), and it is not clear whether the term 
"Tump" also applies locally to features which are apparently natural - either 
because it is an appropriate name for them, or because of a mis-identification of such natural features as the burial mounds of heros 
(for example <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=345000&Y=228000&width=500&height=300&gride=349060.998578357&gridn=230407.415910424&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&right.x=512&right.y=165" target=_new class=place>Coles&nbsp;Tump</A> (<A href="../wormelow-tump.html" target=right>Visit&nbsp;Details</A>) is a natural feature, 
the naming of which may be relatively late<A href="../../references/Verry2005Much.html">*</A>, however, the 
"Tump" part of the name may be mythological, or, indeed, synecdochic  as there are earthwork features on the 
summit<A href="../../references/White1988Coles.html" target=bottom>*</A> that might be (mis?)interpreted as burial mounds).  
</P>
<P>
A very strong third contender must be the Tump at 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=350000&Y=224000&width=500&height=300&gride=349060.998578357&gridn=230407.415910424&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=1&scale=25000" target=_new class=place>St.Weonards</A> (<A href="../wormelow-tump.html" target=right>Visit&nbsp;Details</A>). While current O.S. maps show this 
as a motte (castle mound), older maps mark it as "Tumulus" or "Tump". It is, in fact, a large burial mound 
reused as a motte - it was opened in 1855 and two burnt burials 
found<A href="../../references/White1988Weonards.html" target=bottom>*</A>. The original mound was remodelled and reused 
as one of a series of (Saxon?) defensive mounds spread along the border. Generally such mounds finished up  100-200 foot round and 30-35 foot high<A href="../../references/Bevan1896Survey.html" target=bottom>*</A>. The mound at St.Weonards is currently 
~45 yds (41m) in diameter and 14.5 feet high (4.4m)<A href="../../references/White1988Weonards.html" target=bottom>*</A>. The mound lies pretty much between the 
two most likely sites. Although 
the name sounds Saxon and isn't in the Domesday Book, which might suggest this could be hiding 
a lost Welsh name like <I>Landmore</I> (see <A href="garway.html" target=bottom>Note</A>), it may be derived from the Welsh St.Gwennarth<A href="../../references/Placenames2006Weonard.html">*</A>. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the 1:2500 1st Edition O.S. map for Gamber Head shows something that may be a mound some 70 metres or 
so west of the spring on the other side of the road.
