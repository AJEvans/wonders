The position of Wormelow Tump may give some dating clues. There seems to be a general view in archaeology that 
Neolithic tumuli were positioned in valleys and Bronze Age tumuli were positioned on 
hilltops and ridges (given as a rule of thumb by English Heritage's Steward Ainsworth<A href="../../references/Ainsworth2005Timeteam.html">*</A>; for example, contrast the distribution of 
Neolithic "Oval Barrows" and Bronze Age "Fancy Barrows" given in the English Heritage Monument 
Class Descriptions<A href="../../references/EHMonumentsOval.html">*</A><A href="../../references/EHMonumentsFancy.html">*</A>). As there is 
no lack of surrounding hills this tumulus might have been placed on, its position might suggest a Neolithic age. However, rules of thumb are there to be broken, and there is some doubt about this - for example, see Field<A href="../../references/Field1999Bury.html">*</A> (though note that it is not clear in the 
survey how, or whether, the features were dated or the kinds of statistical tests applied).
