The photo is likely to show the area between 1925 and 1935. 
The Shell-branded pumps are hand-cranked gravity / visible register pumps. These were made from 
1912 to the 1930's<A href="../../references/Benjamin2000Collecting.html" target=bottom>*</A> but were 
common 1925-1935. Shell had their own pumps made in a wide variety of 
forms<A href="../../references/Sid2005Collectable.html" target=bottom>*</A>, though those shown are a little like the 
10 Gallon Wayne 615 (<A href="http://www.oldtymegaspumps.com/item%20613.htm" class=photo target=_new>Photo</A>), 
or the Gilbert &amp; Barker T-176 (<A href="http://www.oldtymegaspumps.com/item%20656.htm" class=photo target=_new>Photo</A>), 
again popular in that decade. 
The Shell Pecten on top of one of the pumps was first used in 1904<A href="../../references/Shell2004Pecten.html" target=bottom>*</A>
The particular form of the Pecten Globe was certainly in use in 1935 but the Pecten 
had changed by 1940<A href="../../references/Marturano2004Fisogni.html" target=bottom>*</A>.

The car is hard to identify, but on the basis of the rounded roof and small window 
it is possibly a 1922-39 Austin Seven "Chummy" (<A href="http://www.austinseven.org.au/1%20History.htm" target=_new>Info</A>; 
<A href="http://www.austinseven.org.au/Saloon_steel_body.htm" class=photo target=_new>Photo</A>) 
(though a ~1915 Ford Model T Tourer (<A href="http://www.modelt.org/gallery/pic.asp?iCat=31&iPic=61" target=_new>Info</A>) might be a possibility).
