An alternative 
<A href="http://www.uidaho.edu/student_orgs/arthurian_legend/origins/mordred.html" target=_new>text</A> has: "There is found at that place a tomb near a fountain, which is called Licat Anir, and the name of the man who is buried in the sepulchral mound was thus designated Anir. He was the son of Arthur the soldier, and he was the one who killed him in the same place and buried him." Note that in the Arthurian Romances, Mordred is the son of Arthur. This name <I>may</I> come from 
the <I>Annales Cambriae</I> which note the death of Arthur and a <I>Medraut</I>, at the Battle of Camlann.
