Despite its attachment to a version of Geoffrey's work, it is clear that Geoffrey did not use 
the Mostyn genealogy, as he has Constantine (Custennin/kustenhin) as fourth in line from 
Conan (Cynan/kynan) which the Mostyn does not<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>. 
This suggests he used a genealogy similar to the 
Jesus Gen. XI, which, combined with later versions, gives<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>...

He then connects Arthur with the famous military leader of about the right time, Custennin.

The general level of completeness is better in the Mostyn manuscript and, assuming no 
editorial input in the published sources, it looks like it contains an older set of name-versions (e.g. 
<A href="../genealogy/tutwal.html">Tutwal</A> for Tudwawl).
However, despite this, the presence of Arthur; the obviously mythographic nature of the early section 
of the genealogy; and the association with Geoffrey, has led most commentators to regard the Jesus 
genealogy as closer to reality and less contaminated by Geoffrey's thinking 
(for example, 
Kirby<A href="../../references/Kirby1976Dynastic.html" target=bottom>*</A>; 
Pearce<A href="../../references/Pearce1971Traditions.html" target=bottom>*</A>).
