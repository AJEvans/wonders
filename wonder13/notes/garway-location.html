<P>
There is some confusion in the published 
reports on this feature's location. Herefordshire Archaeology's records<a href="../../references/Brown1994Garway.html" target="bottom">*</a>  
suggest two sources: one published in the 
local archaeological club journal, the other 
a field observation. The article is actually 
about the major rectangular feature on 
the common, and doesn't mention 
features near the TV Mast. The source must 
therefore be the field observation, 
but the grid reference given is in the 
wood below the common, on the opposite 
side of the hill from the Garron. This may 
be an artifact of interpolation from a much vaguer 
reference through the addition of zeros 
at the end of the reference coordinates. 
</P>
<P>
A reference much closer to the 
position of the rise is given by 
Odling<a href="../../references/Olding2000Easternblack.html" target="bottom">*</a>, 
who also gives a survey of 
the rise.
