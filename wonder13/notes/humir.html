In Welsh the Gamber is apparently known as the <I>Amr</I> (<A href="gamber.html" target=bottom>Note</A>). 
There is actually a second stream of the same name: the <I>Amir</I> or <I>Humir</I> near Newport. The following 
references from the Liber Llan D&#226;v<A href="../../references/Evans1893Llandav.html" target=bottom>*</A>  
(See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>) 
indicate the name...

Cemeis [Inferior]. Its boundary is: Aber Humir on the Usk along to its source. Along the Usk as far as 
Aber Nant Bichan [Vychan<A href="../../references/Evans1893Llandav.html" target=bottom>*</A>] 
as it leads upwards to the breast of the Allt towards the right to the Ard through the Dou Ciuiu

the Arhit [Ard<A href="../../references/Evans1893Llandav.html" target=bottom>*</A>] throughout its 
length to the breast of the Allt, making for the source of Nant Humir, that is Nant Merthir, where the 
boundary began.

Its boundary is: The head of the dyke on the Usk, along the dyke to the breast of the

Along the Lechou downwards as far as the mouth of the pant on the right side. Along the pant upwards as far as its head, to the dyke, along it towards the West to the shoulder of the Allt, to the source of Nant Beth yr Alltudion

on modern maps, is on the east side of the River Usk, where Kemeys House is marked. The second location is the parish of

There are a number of interesting questions raised by these references. The first is the location of the Amir. To identify this we would 
ideally need to identify the Dyke, Nant Bichan, the Lechou, and Nant Beth yr Alltudjon, and decide what was meant by <I>Ard</I> and <I>Allt</I> &ndash; the 
latter of which can mean "hill", "hill-side", "cliff", or even "wood". At the worst we can estimate the location as being a confluence 
large enough to be well known and named, and as downstream of Kemeys. The Cemeis reference is part of a grant record, which 
denotes the area given as ~900m<SUP>2</SUP> and between the wood, field and water. This suggests it is the strip of land 
next to the Usk, below Kemeys Graig. If this is the case, it is likely that the Amir is the stream ending near Aber&nbsp;Nant&nbsp;Farm 
(<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=336000&Y=192000&width=500&height=300&gride=337999.070770349&gridn=192423.798953388&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&down.x=269&down.y=322" target=_new class=place>Map</A>) which sources above Cat's Ash on a Roman road that has had near continuous 
use since the occupation, or that it is the stream that ends at [Great] Bulmore [Farm]. Interestingly the latter is marked on the 1st Edition OS map as "Tomb, site of", but we 
can't get too excited about that as the stream wouldn't have been within Ercing.

The second thing to note is the Humir / Amir name. "H"s before vowels were relatively disposible in the Glamorgan area and surroundings<A href="../../references/Evans1893Llandav.html" target=bottom>*</A>, and here we see evidence of this. This dropping might suggest the Gamber / Amr has an etymology inline with rivers like 
the <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-0.56260&GridN=53.70180&lon=-0.56260&lat=53.70180&search_result=Humber%2C%20Sea&db=freegaz&lang=&keepicon=true&place=Humber%2C%20Sea&pc=&advanced=&client=public&addr2=&quicksearch=humber&addr3=&scale=100000&addr1=" target=_new class=place>Humber</A>. While it is not entirely clear where the name <I>Humber</I> comes from, there are a sufficiently large number of Humbers in Britain 
to suggest it is a pre-Saxon, if not pre-Celtic term, and comparison with other common river names like <I>Avon</I> suggests it might mean something 
like "river". There is, interestingly, a Humber Brook some 20km north of Hereford (passing, for example, through the village of 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=352500&Y=255000&width=500&height=300&gride=356306.253609353&gridn=259648.572547494&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=50000&multimap.x=328&multimap.y=58" target=_new class=place>Humber</A>) &ndash; though there is no evidence of a tomb at its head.
