The argument for the possible location on Garway Hill runs thus. <I>Licat Amir</I> is 
on the Gamber somewhere (see <A href="anir.html">Note</A> on the name). 
Bruce Coplestone-Crow 
has suggested, not unreasonably, that the name mutated into 
<I>Lagademar</I><A href="../../references/CoplestoneCrow1989Herefordshire.html"  target=bottom>*</A> 
("Lagad-emar"), which is is recorded in the Domesday book as in Archenfield, 
TRE<A href="../../references/PRO1085Domesday.html" target=bottom>*</A> (that is, <I>tempora regis Eduardis</I> - in the 
time of Edward the Confessor). 
<I>Lagademar</I> is then annotated "<I>Garwi</I>" in the "Herefordshire Domesday" 
book<A href="../../references/CoplestoneCrow1989Herefordshire.html"  target=bottom>*</A> (a 1160's copy of the Domesday 
with annotations and updates: <A href="http://www.medievalgenealogy.org.uk/guide/feu.shtml" target=_new>Info</A>), indicating they 
are the same location or one is in the other.  
</P>
<P>
As secondary evidence<A href="../../references/CoplestoneCrow1989Herefordshire.html"  target=bottom>*</A> the Domesday Book notes the current holder of the land as 
Herman<A href="../../references/PRO1085Domesday.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(de Dreux<A href="../../references/CoplestoneCrow1989Herefordshire.html"  target=bottom>*</A>). 
In 1189, Richard I entitled to the 'Knights Templar' the area of Langarewi (i.e. Llan Garewi; Llan Garway) 
including with it <I>castellario quod frit 
Hermanii</I><A href="../../references/CoplestoneCrow1989Herefordshire.html"  target=bottom>*</A>. 

Coplestone-Crow  has suggested the castle was at 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-2.72880&GridN=51.85640&lon=-2.72880&lat=51.85640&search_result=Welsh%20Newton%2CHerefordshire&db=freegaz&cidr_client=none&lang=&keepicon=true&place=Welsh+Newton,Herefordshire&pc=&advanced=&client=public&addr2=&quicksearch=Welsh+Newton&addr3=&scale=100000&addr1=" target=_new class=place>Welsh Newton</A>, where Pembridge Castle stood - this would (apparently) have been within the manor of Garway<A href="../../references/CoplestoneCrow1989Herefordshire.html"  target=bottom>*</A>

stretches towards Grosmont Castle on the first Ordnance Survey maps, while 
the castle north at <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=345000&Y=226000&width=500&height=300&gride=349060.998578357&gridn=230407.415910424&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&right.x=510&right.y=168" target=_new class=place>Orcop</A> isn't mentioned in the Domesday book and is therefore thought to be later - neither are 
therefore likely to be associated with Herman's castle).

As for the exact spring, there are a variety of sources coming from the east of 
Garway Hill and eastern Garway (See <A href="../wormelow-tump.html" target=right>Visit&nbsp;Details</A> for examples), all of which enter the Garre(/a)n River<A href="../../references/CoplestoneCrow1989Herefordshire.html"  target=bottom>*</A>. The 1st Edition 1:2500 (1854-1949) O.S. map of the area is littered with springs and spring-related names (e.g. Garway Hill's Spout Cottage and Hawthorn Well; with possible 
springs at <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=346000&Y=223000&width=500&height=300&gride=349060.998578357&gridn=230407.415910424&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&right.x=516&right.y=164" target=_new class=place>Glasshouse Farm</A>, north of Trothland; or on Garway Hill at 
Well House, Garway Hill Chapel, or below the earthworks at Suckling Dingle - note that likely candidates don't include the spring at 
Garway Church, which almost certainly ran west into the Monnow 
[<A href="http://www.smr.herefordshire.gov.uk/db.php?smr_no=9956" target=_new>Details</A>]). Taylor's map of 1754 shows a Garren Spring on Garraway Hill, which was presumably regarded as the source of the Garron.

Sadly, having potentially identified the rough area of the <I>Licat Amir</I> Coplestone-Crow had to leave it at that as, in 1986, there 
were no known burial mounds in the area. However, in 1993 a <I>potential</I> long barrow was identified 
near the <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=343000&Y=225000&width=500&height=300&gride=349060.998578357&gridn=230407.415910424&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&right.x=512&right.y=163" target=_new class=place>TV mast</A><A href="../../references/Brown1994Garway.html" target=bottom>*</A> on Garway Hill 
(long barrows are usually Neolithic 
: <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_barrow" target=_new>Info</A>).  The location of the barrow is 
discussed in this <A href="garway-location.html" target=bottom>Note</A> and photos 
can be seen in <A href="../garway-hill.html" target=right>Visit&nbsp;Details</A>. However, in addition there are a variety of earthworks in the area 
(<A href="http://www.smr.herefordshire.gov.uk/db.php?smr_no=&site_name=garway&parish_1%5B%5D=GARWAY&ee=&nn=&period_general%5B%5D=ALL&site_type_specific%5B%5D=ALL&s=Start+search&SF=1&sortby=parish_1&sortorder=ASC" target=_new>Details</A>) which 
might be of any age up to the early medieval.   
Garway Hill itself is covered in earthworks and it is difficult to say what is or is not ancient 
(See <A href="../wormelow-tump.html" target=right>Visit&nbsp;Details</A>).
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that the nearby  
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=345000&Y=228000&width=500&height=300&gride=349060.998578357&gridn=230407.415910424&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&right.x=512&right.y=165" target=_new class=place>Coles&nbsp;Tump</A> is a natural feature, though the reason for its name is 
unclear and ring and mound features on the summit, while suspected of being mediaeval, await definitive dating [see <A href="other.html">Note</A>]).

This does leave the problem of the name change. Coplestone-Crow 
notes the complete swamping of the original name into "Landmore" in a 1505 
reference<A href="../../references/CoplestoneCrow1989Herefordshire.html"  target=bottom>*</A>. A later reference to this can be found in a 1585 Survey of the Manor...

<P>
However, this parcel of land is lost from any currently available maps.

<P>Given the absence of any mention of Garway in the <I>Historia</I> wonder description, it is perhaps worth considering the name "Garway" more generally. Its absence does not necessarily dictate against the wonder being in the area - the name is also missing from the Domesday, possibly suggesting it wasn't much used. It certainly appears to be a name at least as old as the <I>Historia</I>, so that is no reason for its exclusion. The oldest part of the Liber Llan D&#226;v (See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>) gives the name as <I>Llan Gurboe</I> / <I>Gu</I>(<I>o</I>)<I>ruoe</I> (where <I>u</I> would later be replaced by <I>v</I> or <I>w</I>). The book also suggests the area was given by Guorvodu, king of Ergyng, to Bishop Uvelbin, who gave its living to his priest, 
Guorvoe, hence the name. The use of the double-L here suggests a later date for this text, however, the book also gives the second grant of the land of <I>lann Gouruoe</I> as from Athruis, king of Gwent, to Bishop Comegerius to secure the soul of the king's father Mouric (Meurig) - a grant witnessed by the abbot of <I>Lann Guruoe</I>. This event is most likely to be dated to the 6th C.<A href="../../references/Mathews1912Collections.html" target=bottom>*</A>, and this spelling may be closer to this than the above variant. The grant is interesting if we consider the oft-made suggestion that Arthur and Athruis might be identical, though the evidence for this is thin. This grant included Wormelow as well, as part of the parish of Dewchurch Magna.

White has suggested the name "Garway" alternatively derives from <I>Gaergwy</I> 
("fort above the river")<A href="../../references/White1988Garway.html" target=bottom>*</A>, while Mathews<A href="../../references/Mathews1912Collections.html">*</A> suggests it may also derive from a discription of the river Garron as <I>garw wy</I> "the rough stream(?)". Whichever is true, all the above strongly suggest 
a pre-Saxon influence - confusing in light of the name's absence from the Domesday Book. Strangely, given this set of potential origins, there is an alternative Welsh name for Garway 
of <I>Llanwrfwy</I><A href="../../references/Vision2005Garway.html" target=bottom>*</A>. This simply seems to have been derived from an earlier spelling ((<I>G</I>)<I>uorvei</I>?)(note also that in the local village name 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-2.81220&GridN=51.93840&lon=-2.81220&lat=51.93840&place=Bagwyllydiart,Herefordshire&db=freegaz&scale=100000&search_result=Bagwyllydiart%2CHerefordshire&lang=&db=freegaz&keepicon=true" class=place target=_new>Bagwy&nbsp;Llydiart</A>, <I>Llidiart</I> refers to a "gate" and is not a corruption of <I>Llicat</I>).

Incidentally, just in case you're looking to plot the next in a long line of dubious  
Templar books, you might be interested to know they built one of their round churches in 
Garway (See <A href="../wormelow-tump.html" target=right>Visit&nbsp;Details</A>: <A href="../photos/garway-church-plan.html" target=right>Plan</A>). 
Even with rebuilding, it is an unusual and beautiful piece of history 
(<A href="http://www.smr.herefordshire.gov.uk/db.php?smr_no=7160" target=_new>Info</A>; 
<A href="http://www.britannia.com/history/herefords/churches/garway.html" target=_new>Info</A>). 
There are no burial mounds in the vicinity - despite leaflets in the church indicating ancient 
earthworks in the field below the building, however, it's not uncommon for churches to be built on the 
site of previous features (henges, for example) so it is possible a tump has been 
destroyed. One can but look forward to the suggestion the church was built on the site of our wonderous tomb...
