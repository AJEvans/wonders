While you're in 
the area, Garway Church is worth a visit. While the site may be in Garway 
parish<SUP><A href="notes/garway.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>, and 
there are springs here (one near the church and a series of ponds in the main village  
(<A href="photos/garway-pond1.html">Photo</A>; <A href="photos/garway-pond2.html">Photo</A>), 
there are no burial mounds - despite leaflets in the church indicating ancient 
earthworks in the field below the building. It would not be uncommon for churches to be built on the 
site of previous features (henges, for example), so it is possible a tump has been 
destroyed, however, the church is interesting in itself for its architecture, its  
architectural history (<A href="photos/garway-church1.html">Photo</A>; <A href="photos/garway-church2.html">Photo</A>;

Between Garway Hill and Wormelow are a number of less probable site for the wonder: notably 
Cole's Tump, a natural feature, but one covered in earthworks (<A href="photos/coles-tump.html">Photo</A>) 
and close to a large circular spring-pool (<A href="photos/coles-spring.html">Photo</A>), 
and St.Weonard's Tump (<A href="photos/st-weonards-tump.html">Photo</A>), which is a burial mound reused as a motte on which to 
build a Norman castle<SUP><A href="notes/destroyed.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>.
