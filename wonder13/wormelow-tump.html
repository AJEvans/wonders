The burial mound that Wormelow Tump was named after, potential Wonder of Britain and tomb of Arthur's son, the place which acted as the 
gathering point for the legal and social networks of the Welsh borderlands for centuries, 
has apparently been wiped from the earth and replaced by a a stretch of road and a petrol station.

It's not entirely clear when or why<SUP><A href="notes/destroyed.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP> the tump was destroyed, but all that remains 
is the village, the local pub name (the "Wormelow Tump Inn", built 
c.1780 C.E<A href="../references/Verry2005Much.html" target=bottom>*</A>), and a small reference to the tump as 
one of Nennius' Wonders of Britain on the pub wall. One of the locals in the pub 
suggested that the tump could also be seen on one of the pub's photos from the 
beginning of the 20th C.<SUP><A href="notes/photodate.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>
(<A href="photos/wormelow-tump-closeup.html" class=photo>closeup</A> of the area: 1880's <A href="notes/wormelow-map.html">map</A> also showing photo direction). 
If this <I>is</I> the tump, then here's <A href="photos/wormelow-tump-switch.html" class=photo>before and after</A> shots.

However. The Isaac Taylor <A href="notes/wormelow-taylor-map.html">map</A> of 1754 shows the tump to the north of the crossroads 
the pub is on, in the clump of trees behind the roadsign on this <A href="photos/wormelow-tump-crossroads.html">photo</A>. In contrast, 
another local suggested it used to be in the fields behind one of the walls to the left of the same photo - i.e. opposite the 
pub. Finally, yet another suggested the tump was never a burial mound, but instead was a local hill, as depicted on the 
pub sign (<A href="photos/wormelow-sign.html">Photo</A>) - though there certainly was a 
mound here as it was excavated<SUP><A href="notes/wormelow.html" target=bottom>3</A>,</SUP>. In short, it is difficult to say where it 
was, though perhaps asking in a pub wasn't the best of plans.

If Wormelow was the site of the wonder, it seems likely that Gamber Head was the spring 
referred to. Gamber Head is currently<SUP><A href="notes/gamberhead.html" target=bottom>4</A></SUP> just south of Wormelow, up against the eastern 
side of the A466. 
There is a covered well or spring housing next to Gamber Head Farm, from which a stream issues (<A href="photos/gamber-head.html">Photo</A>).
