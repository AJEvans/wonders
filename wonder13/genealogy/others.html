<P>
Of course, the mother of Anir need not be Gvenhvyuar. There has been some suggestion that 
he was a down-trodden character because he was illegitimate (<A href="../notes/anir.html" target=bottom>Note</A>). Although the evidence for this 
doesn't seem particularly strong, the triad "[Arthur's] Three Mistresses"<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
does list Indeg, daughter of Garwy the Tall; Garwen ("Fair leg") daughter of 
Henin the Old; and G&#0373;yl ("Modest"), daughter of Gendawd, so there is some potential. 
</P>
<P>In addition, it is worth noting the 
triad "Arthur's Three Great Queens"<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>, which lists three Gvenhvyuars - 
daughters in turn of (G)Ocuran Gavr, (G)Vthyr son of Greidiavl, and G(/C)vryt Gvent. 
Bromwich<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> suggests this 
might be 1) a joke 2) a common celtic motif in which three siblings are given the same 
name (though this seems unlikely given the parentage) or 3) an early indication of the story of the "false Gwenhwyfar" who takes her 
place in some of the Romance stories. It could, of course, also be a commentary on 
a dubious paternity.
