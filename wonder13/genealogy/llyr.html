<P>
Llyr half-speech (or "half-national" or 
"lisping Llyr"<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>) is almost certainly a mythological ancestor - 
he was the father of Bran, Branwen and Manawydan (Manann&#225;n Mac Lir) amongst others, all of who appear in early Welsh stories. 
</P>
<P>
He himself has a variety of 
ancestries - Bromwich<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> gives two:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Ll&#0375;r son of Ffaraon son of Dd.(Dandde) son of Mael Dicko son of Kryf son of Dyfnwal Moelmud<BR>
Ll&#0375;r son of Paran son of Kerihir Llyngwyn son of Keidio Bywrmwyn son of Arthan son of Meirion 
son of Gerient son of Graydiol son of Dyngad son of Albean Tirvad son of Anny son(?) of Galbean</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The text associated with the latter places him at 55 <SPAN class=smallcaps>BCE</SPAN>. 
 

<P>
Bromwich<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> rapidly dispatches the notion, held later, that Ll&#0375;r was the original King Lear. 
However, she takes the view there <I>may</I> be evidence for a link between 
Ll&#0375;r and Welsh hero Llud Llaw Ereint: Ll&#0375;r appears as 
one of the three "exulted prisoners of the Island of Britain" in 
the triads in the Red Book of Hergest (see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>), but the same triad in "Culhwch and Olwen" (<A href="../../twrch/myth.html" target=right>Details</A>) has Llud in his place. 
Llud, in turn, is likely to be based on No(/u)do(/e)ns , a British God worshiped at 
the Romano-British temple at 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=360000.669691472&Y=205000.823562793&width=500&height=300&gride=362425.669691472&gridn=203182.823562793&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=1&scale=200000" target=_new class=place>Lydney Park</A>, 
Gloucestershire (<A href="http://www.roman-britain.org/places/lydney.htm" target=_new>Info</A>). 
The connection suggested for all three is via an Irish original <I>Nuadu</I> and the fact that both 
Nodons and Ll&#0375;r appear associated with the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Llud was son of Beli Mawr (the celtic god Belenos), the most over-used of all ancestors, who was, in turn, son of Manogan or possibly Dyfnwal Moelmud 
(Britain's legendary law-maker), with his mother (or wife) being Anna. Anna, just to take the all-inclusiveness of this to its naturally absurd ends, was the cousin of the virgin Mary, though might also be Danu - the Irish mother of the gods<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
<P>
Either way, Arthur's family had quite a start in life.
