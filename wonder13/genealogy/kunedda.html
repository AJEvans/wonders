Kunedda Wledic (Cunedda [possibly also Kynadaf"<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>; 
Cunedag<A href="../../references/Kirby1976Dynastic.html" target=bottom>*</A>] : "Good Lord"<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>; 
Wledig (or earlier "Guletic") probably denotes a British military leader<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>). 
Cunedda is noted in the <I>Historia</I> (Sections 14 and 62) as expelling the Scots from <I>Guenedota</I> (Gwynedd), with the aid of his 12 sons, 
after coming there from <I>Manau Guotodin</I> (in North Britain - the land of the Gododdin: 
see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>). 
His elegy, which was included in the Book of Taliesin (See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>) 
harkens back to the period in the North  
(<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/t46.html" target=_new>English Translation</A>).

His great-great-grandson is 
noted in the <I>Historia</I> as Mailcunus, king of Guenedotae. Maelgwn Gwynedd died in the plague of 547 or 449 according to the 
<I>Annales Cambriae</I><a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a> 
(See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>)  
and the <I>Historia</I> notes some 146 years between Cunedda arriving and Maelcun reigning. This 
gives a latest date for the movement of Cunedda of 
401<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>, though Bromwich has some 
doubts and places it as late as 450 (<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>p.437; 
see also Kirby<A href="../../references/Kirby1976Dynastic.html" target=bottom>*</A>).

<P>
The Harleian Manuscript 3859 genealogies (See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>) 
give the lineage of Mailcun of Gwynedd as:

who was Beli the big's son, and Anna, his mother, who they say is the cousin of Mary the Virgin, mother of our lord 
Jesus Christ.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</P>
Note, that this genealogy gives Cunedda a grandaughter Guaul [Gwawl] (a separate Genealogy for Cadog ties this family also to 
that of Meurig [See <A href="../../wonder11/index.html" target=right>Wonder&nbsp;11</A>], by making Cadog the grandchild of 
Tewdric).

<P>
For an examination of Cunedda as the head of a large number of Welsh ruling families, and the division of large chunks 
of Wales between his sons, see Kirby<A href="../../references/Kirby1976Dynastic.html" target=bottom>*</A>. For a character 
assassination of Maelgwn, see Gildas' letters (See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>).
