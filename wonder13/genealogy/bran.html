Bran ("Raven") Vendigeit (~"Blessed")<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> was the son of Ll&#0375;r and Penardun, Beli's daughter (which complicates things if Ll&#0375;r was Beli's son!: see 
<A href="llyr.html">Ll&#0375;r</A>). He features (as Bendigeid Vran) in the Welsh "Mabinogion" tale 
<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/branwen.html" target=_new>Branwen</A> as a giant hero with a 
zombie-making cauldron, who's head was buried at White Mount (Tower Hill?) in London to protect the nation.

<P>
Bran is almost certainly the Fisher King "Bron" of later Grail Romances<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>, 
so gloriously over-signified in <I>From Ritual to Romance</I> by Jessie Weston<A href="../../references/Weston1920Ritual.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
