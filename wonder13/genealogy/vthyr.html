Vthyr (Bendragon; Uthyr Penndra(g)on: "Chief Dragon" - dragon being a euphemism for warrior in the oldest Welsh 
poetry<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>. 
<I>Uthr</I> means "terrible"<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>). 
While there is no definitive evidence of Uythr being Arthur's father before Geoffrey of 
Monmouth<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a> 
(See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>), Uythr appears in the Arthurian poems <I>Pa mor</I> 
(<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/bbc31.html" target=_new>English&nbsp;translation</A>), 
which is likely to be 10th or 11th C.<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>, and 
<I>Marvnat vthyr pen.</I> 
("The Death-song of Uthyr Pen.": <A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/t48.html" target=_new>English&nbsp;translation</A>). 
The poem <I>Ymddiddan Arthur a'r Eryr</I> ("The Colloquy of Arthur and the Eagle": 
<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/eagle.html" target=_new>English&nbsp;translation</A>) suggests Vrthyr's son, Madawc, 
had a child that was Arthur's nephew. While this poem isn't pre-Geoffrey in its current 
form<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>, 
it does suggest an independent tradition as Madawc isn't mentioned by 
Geoffrey<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>.

Uthyr appears in the Welsh Triads<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a> 
(See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>) 
twice. He appears as one of the people knowing one of the "Three Great Enchantments of the Island of Britain". 
What this enchantment is is not clear. Geoffrey gives us the tale of Uthyr, with help from Merlin, taking on the 
form of Gorlois (Gwrleis), duke of Cornwall, to sleep with his wife Igerna (<A href="eigr.html">Eigr</A>) and thus beget 
Arthur<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>. The Triad notes that 
Uthyr passed on his enchantment secret to Menw son of Teirgwaedd, and in the Welsh tale 
<I>Culhwch ac Olwen</I> (<A href="../../twrch/summary.html" target=right>Summary</A>)  this person is given as a shapeshifter, perhaps 
suggesting Uthyr originally needed no help in the seduction<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a> and 
had the trick already up his sleeve.
</P>
<P>
The second Triad he appears in is the heavily influenced by Geoffrey "The Three Men of Shame who were in the 
Island of Britain"<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>. 
In this he is listed as brother of Emrys Wledig and killer, with him, of the treacherous Gwrtheyrn 
the Thin [Vortigern] who invited the Saxons into Britain and exiled the brothers to 
Armorica<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>. Though this is hardly a source 
worth relying on, it would place him c.449 <SPAN class="smallcaps">CE</SPAN> according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles 
(See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>).
