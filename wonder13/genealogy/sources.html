<P>
Arthur's paternal branch is taken from the Mostyn Manuscript 117 
(<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/mostyn117.html" target=_new>online version</A>). 
Arthur's maternal line is given in the Vitellius C.IX manuscript as given 
by Bromwich<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>. Gvenhvyuar's 
father is given in two triads<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>. 
Llacheu is denoted as Arthur's son pretty much everywhere 
he appears in Welsh literature, while Duran is rather more speculative and based on 
one verse. See the sons' notes for details. For the critical discussion of the sources see this 
<A href="../notes/mostyn.html" target=bottom>Note</A>.
