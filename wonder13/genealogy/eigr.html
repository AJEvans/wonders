Eigr. 
Other than the evidence that she was the daughter of <A href="amlawd.html">Amlawd Wledig</A> there is little old 
evidence for this person. Her name first appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth's History 
(See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>) as "Igerna", and then 
in the <I>Brut Dingestow</I>(See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>) 
as "Eigr"<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>.

In the 14th C. poem "The Birth of Arthur" it's noted that she was married to 
Emyr Llydaw before marrying 
Gwrleis<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> (Gorlois). In Geoffrey, 
<A href="vthyr.html">Uthyr</A> uses magic to disguise himself as 
Gorlois in order to get to Igerna and beget Arthur. In "The Birth of Arthur" 
Eigr is noted as having two daughters by Gwrleis, Gwyar (Anna in Geoffrey and Mostyn 177<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>) and Dioneta. Gwyar 
has a son Hywel by Ymer Llydaw, and two others Gwalchmei (Garwain) and Medrawd (Mordred), plus 
three daughters - Gracia, Graeria and Dioneta - by Lleu ap 
Cynfarch<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>. While many of these 
characters appear in roughly these relationships in earlier sources, this poem 
gives the most reasonable structure<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>.  
The Mostyn 177 genealogies give Anna as the daughter of Vthyr, and as having a daughter Nonn who gave birth 
to [St.]David.
