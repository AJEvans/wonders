Amlawd Wledig (Anblaud<a href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target="bottom">*</a> 
probably earliest form. "Amlawd" could be "very swift", "very terrible" or "intense tumult" - alternatively it 
may be from the Norse "Olafr" via Saxon "Amlethus" ["Hamlet"]<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>; Wledig 
(or earlier "Guletic") probably denotes a British military leader<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>). 
Arthur's mother is listed as Eigr daughter of Amlawd Wledic in 
the <I>Brut Dingestow</I><a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a> 
(See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>). 
In <I>Culhwch ac Olwen</I> (<A href="../../twrch/summary.html" target=right>Summary</A>) 
Arthur and Culhwch are noted as cousins and Culhwch's 
mother is flagged as the daughter of Anlavd 
Wledic<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>. 
"The Life of St. Illtud" in the Cotton Vespasian A14 Manuscript (c.1100&nbsp;-&nbsp;1150&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>) also gives the saint 
as Arthur's cousin and his grandfather as Anblaud, king of Brittany<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a> 
(or possibly Britain? Latin is <I>Brittannie regis</I>: <A href="http://jrider.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/2001f/fren234/01/lifeofstilltudlatin.htm" target=_new>online</A>).

It is possible, based on the Triad "The Three Exculted Prisoners of the Island of Britain" 
(See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>) that there was an old Devon tale centring on the three grandsons of 
Amlawd - Arthur, Culhwch and Goreu<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>.
In the triad, Arthur is rescued from three prisons by Goreu.
