kadvr (Cadwr): little is known of this person, except what's mentioned for "Cador, Duke of Cornwall"  
by "the History of the Kings of Britain" (see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>). 
In this tale he is a friend of Arthur and provides 
his successor. Bromwich<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a> has suggested 
he is Cadwy/Cado/Catovius who is mentioned in various early British Saints' lives as being part of the 
ruling family of Cornwall, and possibly co-ruling that area with Arthur (if he ever existed at all).
