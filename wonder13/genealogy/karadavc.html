Karadavc (Caradawg/Caradaog) may have been a popular Romano-British name - there are several 
kings named this or similar. This Caradawg, son of Bran, features in the Welsh "Mabinogion" tale of 
his aunt, <a href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/branwen.html" target="_new">Branwen</a>. In the tale  
he is left in charge of Britain with a group of officers, all of whom are killed by one of his 
parents' cousins, who was wearing a cloak of invisibility. Left alive, Caradawg went mad with confusion and died - featuring  
as one of the "Three people who broke their hearts from bewilderment" in the Welsh Triads, along with 
his aunt herself<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>.

<P>
Although there is a possibility this figure is based on Carat&#257;cus (&lt;35&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;&gt;51&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN> : <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caratacus" target=_new>Biography</A>), 
Bromwich<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a> points out that no one 
appears to have believed this before 1700 and rates it as a poor attempt to tie both 
Carat&#257;cus and the Welsh genealogies to the introduction of christianity to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the same person or not, neither Caradawg 
nor Carat&#257;cus could have expected that <A href="http://www.rolfharris.com/music/lyrics_thecourt.htm" target=_new>this</A> would 
have been their contribution to posterity...
