Moruavr is largely unknown. Tutwal's father is listed elsewhere (Jesus College MS 20: see <a href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target="right">Other Works</a>) as G6rwa6r (where the Mid-Welsh "6" symbol is pronounced "u" and was sometimes written "u" or 
"v" (later "w")<A href="../../references/Strachan1909Early.html" target=bottom>*</A>: <I>Gurwamur</I> or <I>Guoremor</I>), which might be the same (Moruavr -> Guoraiur -> Guoremor), however he is listed as son of Gadeon (Kadvr?) son of Conan (Kynan) (in addition, the "w" in G6rwa6r may  
replace "v", ultimately to written in modern Welsh "f": <I>Gwrfawr</I>).
