Kynan (Conan - yes, really... In Old Welsh probably Kenan [see Bromwich<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a> p.548]) appears as a warrior who will return to save Britain from 
the Saxons in the poem <I>Armes Prydein</I> (c.930&nbsp;<SPAN=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>: see 
<A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>), and is 
probably the Conan Meiriadog of the "History of the Kings of Britain" (see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>). 
In the Welsh Tale "<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/macsen.html" target=_new>the Dream of Maxen</A>"  
(which is probably not based on "the History of the Kings of Britain"<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>) Kynan follows 
his brother-in-law Maxen, who is proclaimed Roman Emperor, to Europe and is instrumental 
in the taking of Rome. Kynan then settles in Brittany, setting it up as a part of a 
British nation. It is likely the story reflects the proclamation of the Emperor 
Maximus in 383&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN> in Britain, and his removal of British troops to the continent<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>, possibly combined with a separate 
expedition to Brittany (Pearce<A href="../../references/Pearce1971Traditions.html" target=bottom>*</A> gives this 
argument in detail, and suggests this frees up Kynan to have been alive at the same time as later expeditions to Brittany 
c.500&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>). Details of the additional story of 
Kynan's attempted marriage to St. Ursula can be found <A href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15225d.htm" target=_new>here</A>.

The Dream adds a father, Eudav, between Kynan and Karadavc. Cynan also appears as the son of 
Eudaf Hen (Eudav the old) in a dynastic genealogy (Jesus College MS 20: see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>). 
Though it isn't clear whether this is the "Eudaf" mentioned later in our genealogy it seems likely there's 
been a confusion.
