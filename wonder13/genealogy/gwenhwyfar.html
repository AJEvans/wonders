Gvenhvyuar ("White phantom" or Gwenhwy-mawr "Gwenhwy the great" in contrast to her sister 
Gwenhv(/w)y-(v)ach mentioned in <I>Culhwch ac Olwen</I><A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>; 
Geoffrey of Monmoth [see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>] 
gives the possibly older Guenhuuera/Guanhumara<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>). 
The Bruts and two triads (see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>) 
have her as the daughter of (G)ogvran Gawr ("(G)ogvran the giant")<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that the most significant role Gvenhvyuar plays in the Arthurian story is through her abduction and 
the possibly resulting battle, which ended Arthur's life. 

In Caradog's <I>Vita Gildae</I> Gildas arrives at King 
Melvas' city of Glastonbury to find it under siege from Arthur with the armies of Cornwall and Devon. Arthur is fighting for the return of 
Guennuvar, whom Melvas has abducted. Gildas negotiates the return of Arthur's wife. This story almost certainly antedates Geoffrey of 
Monmouth<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
and it is interesting in giving Arthur a South-Western command similar to many of the older sources. 
Geoffrey has Guanhumara abducted by Arthur's nephew 
Modred (Medrawt in the Bruts)<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>. <P>
From the triad 
"the three Unrestrained Ravagings of the Island of Britain"<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> we learn that 
Medrawd came to Arthur's court at Celliwig in Cornwall, drank and ate everything, then 
he dragged Gwenhvyuar from her chair and hit her - though we don't actually know whether this 
refers to the abduction implicitly. Either way Arthur went to Medrawd's court in turn 
and took everything there.
</P>
</P>
<P>
With regard Anir, a few points are worth noting about the abduction. The first is that 
both Modred, the son of Arthur's sister Anna (see <A href="eigr.html">Eigr</A>), and 
Amr appear to have gained Arthur's displeasure and been killed by him in battle, 
possibly suggesting they are one and the same. The shift from wife-abducting son 
to wife-abducting nephew might also be present in the story of Tristan and Isolde 
(see <A href="kynuavr.html">Kynuavr</A>). The second is that it has been 
speculated that Amr was regarded by Arthur as a lower-class citizen because he was 
illegitimate. More likely, one might have thought, that if true it would be 
because he was the result of the abduction of Gvenhvyuar, though plainly this 
can't be true if our first speculation is. The third is the pairing of 
good-bad siblings within the Arthurian family: 
Medrawt-Gwalchmei  (see <A href="eigr.html">Eigr</A>) 
and Amr-Llacheu. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, to continue: from the triad 
"the Three Harmful Blows of the Island of Britain"<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
we learn that Gwenhwyfar was hit by her sister Gwenhwyfach, and that this caused the battle 
of Camlan(n) 
This quarrel-inspired battle was one of "the Three Futile Battles of the 
Island of Britain"<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> - the <i>Annales Cambriae</i> (See <a href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target="right">Other&nbsp;Works</a>)  
list its date as 537 <SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>, and note that both Arthur and Medraut died there. 
Sites for the battle have been speculated as Camboglanna/Birdoswald on Hadrian's Wall or the River Camel in 
Cornwall<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>, though there are a vast number of suggested alternatives of varying sanity. 
Given the Modred-Amr similarity, 
it is tempting to add the Gamber site of <A href="../index.html" target=right>Wonder&nbsp;13</A> to them (it has more going for it than 
most), though to do so would be to elicit, quite rightly, the collected groans of Arthurian scholars worldwide.</P>
<P>
Wherever it was, the triad 
"the Three Unfortunate Counsels of the Island of Britain"<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> implies that Arthur 
failed to win the battle because he divided his men into three units and possibly gave some to Medrawd, 
perhaps though the plotting of 
Idawc Cord Prydein ("Idawc, Agitator of Britain")<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A>, who in the Welsh tale 
"the Dream of Rhonabwy" 
(<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/rhonabwy.html" target=_new>English translation</A>) 
claims to have altered messages between the two. The fact noted in the triad  
 "the Three Faithless War Bands of the Island of Britain"<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> that the war band of 
one friend slid off the night before, cannot have helped the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, Post-Geoffrey the Bruts lay the battle not at the feet of a sibling spat between 
Gwenhwyfar and Gwenhwyfach, but at the feet of treacherous Medrawd with foreign allies, 
essentially saying he claimed the kingdom while Arthur was fighting the Roman Emperor abroad. This is 
despite early Bardic sources have him as a generally good person. Indeed, he is included in the list 
"the 24 Knights of Arthur's 
Court"<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target=bottom>*</A> as one of the three Royal Knights whom no one could 
refuse on account of their beauty and wisdom.
</P>
<P>
Of course, all this confusion is not entirely irreconcilable - perhaps Gwenhwyfar 
fell, Stockholm-like, for pretty-boy Medrawd, a fact only revealed upon her return 
by her sister. She is, after all, listed in the triad the "Three Faithless Wives of the Island of 
Britain". Still, it all adds to the general confusion of the Arthurian picture.
