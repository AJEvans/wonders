Tutwal (Tudwal: "Tribe-leader"<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>) is largely unknown from this 
context. There is a chance this person is the British king <I>Tuduvallus</I>/<I>Thuvahel</I> noted in the life of 
St. Ninian by Ailred of Rievaulx and an 8th C. latin poem on the 
same theme<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>. 
Mention of the death of St.Martin in Ninian's life, which is known to have been in 397 
<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><a href="../../references/Catholic2003Ninian.html" target="bottom">*</a>, places 
the king at about this time. Ninian is, however, associated with Scotland, and <I>Tuduvallus</I> is probably the same person as 
Tudwal Tutklyd, given as "son of Kedic son of Dyfynwal Hen" in the "Pedigrees of the Men of the North" (i.e. the old North of the Scottish 
borderlands and Yorkshire)<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>. This seems to dictate against this being the same person as our Tutwal, who is in a Cornish genealogy, though there is 
a thin chance they are the same.

Tudwal Tutklyt is mentioned in the Welsh triads as the father of Ryderch Hael ("the generous")<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>. The "Whetstone of Tudwal Tutklyd" is 
one of the "Thirteen treasures of [Northern] Britain" (see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>). A brave man's 
sword sharpened on the stone meant certain death for opponents, even if it drew only a small amount of blood. A cowards sword, 
however, was rendered useless<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>. Ryderch was known as generous because he would freely lend another of the treasures - his sword Dyrnwyn ("white tip") 
which would burst into flame if a well-born man drew it - though its nature meant no one asked<a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>.

The spelling of Tutwal may mark the Mostyn list as 
of older origins than the Jesus College MS 20 (see <a href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</a>) which 
lists him with a "d" not a "t" ("t" replacing "d" until 1200 <SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><a href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html" target="bottom">*</a>), though see <A href="../notes/mostyn.html" target=bottom>Note</A>.
