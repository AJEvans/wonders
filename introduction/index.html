Around 829 <SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><SUP><A href="notes/date.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP> the Monk 
Nennius<SUP><A href="notes/nennius.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP> (or  
someone!<SUP><A href="notes/author.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP>) to have compiled a 
series of historical documents into the <I>Historia Brittonum</I>
- the "History of Britain"<SUP><A href="notes/historia.html" target=bottom>4</A></SUP>. Appended 
to the end of some copies of this History that we have today 
are a series of "Wonders"<SUP><A href="notes/mirabilibus.html" target=bottom>5</A></SUP>, 
in the vein of the "Seven Wonders of the World"<SUP><A href="notes/sevenWonders.html" target=bottom>6</A></SUP>. 
Only Nennius' Wonders are different: they aren't constructed by people: they 
are, instead, a mix of the geographical<SUP><A href="notes/geographical.html" target=bottom>7</A></SUP> 
and mythological, rooted in the very foundations of 
Britain<SUP><A href="notes/myth.html" target=bottom>8</A></SUP>.

This website will help you learn more about Nennius' Wonders: their 
art and science, and the way in which they act as pins, fastening 
Britain today to a hidden landscape of dark age mythology.
