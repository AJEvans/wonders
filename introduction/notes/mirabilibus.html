The Latin phrase used in some manuscripts as a heading for this section is <I>de mirabilibus britanniae</I>, 
which has been translated as The "Wonders", "Marvels", or "Miracles" of Britain. 
The Wonders are not present in all copies of the <I>Historia</I> - you can find details of which they 
are present in on the <A href="../../history/manuscripts.html" target=right>Manuscripts</A> page. 
The Irish version of the History, which you can find 
<A href=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100028/index.html" target=_new>here</A>, contains a slightly different list.
