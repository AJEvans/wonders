It is unlikely that we have an original copy of this work, so dating 
its writing is difficult - not least because the <I>Historia</I> is made up 
of older material, and the currently extant manuscripts have obviously 
be derived from a mix of manuscripts we don't have. Each has earlier and/or 
later material. Morris<A href="../../references/Morris1980Nennius.html">*</A> 
suggests between 796&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>, which is the last date quoted 
in the section known as the <I>Northern History</I>, and 806&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN> which is suggested by 
<A href="../../history/manuscripts.html#C" target="right">Manuscript 'C'</A> 
as the date of its original. However, it 
is likely that the two oldest examples are in 
'<A href="../../history/manuscripts.html#A" target="right">A</A>' and 
the 
'<A href="../../history/manuscripts.html#Vatican" target="right">Vatican</A>'.
'A' gives a complex calculation from the birth of Jesus, through various other dates, to the 
date of origin, which suggests 829&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../../references/Dumville1974Chronology.html">*</A> 
while the Vatican is probably from 944&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../../references/Dumville1975Nennius.html">*</A> 

This is not to say the manuscripts themselves are this age, just the text in them, 
though the Vatican manuscript was dated by Gunn and the librarians of the 
Vatican on the basis of caligraphy to the 10th 
Century<A href="../../references/Gunn1819Nennius.html">*</A>. However, 
overall, dates claimed by the manuscripts vary from 796&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN> to 
994&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../../references/Stevenson1838Nennius.html">*</A>.
