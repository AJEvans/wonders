There is actually considerable debate as to who made the compilation. Many manuscripts 
ascribe the the history to Gildas 
(<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gildas" target=_new>Biography</A>) 
another monkish 
historian (or possibly two 
Gildases<A href="../../references/Gunn1819Nennius.html">*</A>), while the manuscript from the Vatican is ascribed to "Mark the Hermit, a 
British Bishop"<A href="../../references/Stevenson1838Nennius.html">*</A>. 
You can read a detailed discussion of the 
arguments about the authorship by Robert Vermaat in his excellent <A href="http://www.vortigernstudies.org.uk/artsou/historia.htm" target=_new>summary</A> at Vortigern Studies, 
or in Dumville<A href="../../references/Dumville1975Nennius.html">*</A> vs. 
Field<A href="../../references/Field1996Nennius.html">*</A>, or, in the case of Mark, 
Newell<A href="../../references/Newell1905Doubts.html">*</A>
</P>
<P>Gildas' venomous <I>De excidio Britann(i)ae liber querulus</I> ("the Fall/Ruin/Capture of Britain, a 
whining book": see 
<A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target="right">Other Works</A>), 
written c.545&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>
<A href="../../references/Wiseman2003HeroicAge.html">*</A> , is regarded as one of the more reliable accounts 
of the age. It is a gloriously tirade against the sinful 
uselessness of the British. A life of St.Germanus, written by Constantius Hericus mentions a British Bishop 
Mark as giving the information which is also in the <I>Historia</I> in 876/7&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../../references/Stevenson1838Nennius.html">*</A>
