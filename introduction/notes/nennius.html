Nennius (or, variously: Ninnius; 
Nemnius<A href="../../references/Dumville1975Nennius.html">*</A><A href="../../references/Dumville1977Celtic.html">*</A>) reveals himself as 
a possible author of the <I>Historia</I> in a prologue in some of the 
copies still in existence. He notes that he is a pupil of Elvodug (Elffodw).
The Welsh Annals (<I>Annales Cambriae</I>: see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>) 
note Elvodug twice: in 768&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN> he was responsible for ensuring the date of 
Easter was correctly calculated in Wales, and his death is noted in 809&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>. This gives us 
a rough time for Nennius to have lived. There is an additional work (Oxford, Bodleian Library Auct. F.4.32 (S.C.2176) fo.20<SUP>r</SUP>) from 
817&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../../references/Dumville1975Nennius.html">*</A> by <I>a</I> Nennius, which is an <A href="../alphabet.html" target=right>alphabet</A> parodying English runes, 
made up to refute an English (i.e. ~Saxon) scholar who suggested the 
British (i.e.~Welsh) had no alphabet of their own<A href="../../references/Morris1980Nennius.html">*</A>.  Further 
details on this can be found in Robert Vermaat's excellent 
<A href="http://www.vortigernstudies.org.uk/artsou/historia.htm">summary</A> at 
Vortigern Studies. On the basis of the above, and the manuscript 
dates<SUP><A href="date.html">1</A></SUP>, classical suggestions that the writer is the Nennius 
mentioned in Geoffrey of Monmouth's <I>Historia Regum Britanniae</I> (i.17+)
(<A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target="right">Other Works</A>) have largely been 
abandoned.
