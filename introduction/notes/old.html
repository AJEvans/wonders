One might well ask what such a list means. Why and how did it come about? 
First, however, one has to determine <I>when</I> it came about. 
Let's look at the dating evidence.
<UL>
<LI>First we know it was written before the earliest manuscript it is found in. 
However, this is not as straightforward as one might imagine. The earliest 
Manuscript available is the 10th&nbsp;<SPAN=smallcaps>C</SPAN> <A href="history/manuscripts.html#Vatican">Vatican</A> 
manuscript, but this does not include the Wonder list. Despite this, the 
earliest version of the text is probably from the  <A href="history/manuscripts.html#A">Harleian MS.3859</A>, the 
text of which was probably originally structured c.829&nbsp;<SPAN=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>, despite the 
manuscript it has been copied into dating to c.1100 (the Vatican text only dating 
in the same way to c.944&nbsp;<span class="smallcaps">CE</span>)<a href="../../references/Dumville1974Chronology.html">*</a> <a href="../../references/Dumville1975Nennius.html">*</a>. 
Nevertheless, in the absence of an explicit date in this section, the list could have been compiled at any 
time up to 1100 on this basis. We don't know that the list was definitely in the 829 original. The Irish 
versions of the <I>Historia</I>, which appear to have been constructed c.1072 have mutated 
versions of the Latin list, much truncated, so it must have existed by then.
</LI>
<LI>However, we know the manuscript was composed of older material drawn together, so of it at least 
matching with information from Gildas, who wrote in c.545&nbsp;<span class="smallcaps">CE</span>
<a href="../../references/Wiseman2003HeroicAge.html">*</a>. Not only this, but the sections that seem 
to have been available to Gildas are very similar to the Wonder lists; for example, Gildas quotes 
Britain as being famous for its "eight and twenty cities", which might imply a city list like that of 
the <I>Historia</I> had been circulating before this time.</LI>

<LI>What then, of the internal evidence of the list? The list appears to be compiled from a 
variety of sources. The style and length of the various wonders is quite variable, and it is 
possible that <A href="/wonder11/">Wonder&nbsp;11</A>, was taken from verse. The author of the 
<I>Historia</I> only really speaks in the first person to say the list has been constructed 
from earlier sources, except that they break into the Wonder list to confirm they have 
witnessed some of the Wonders. If the two first-person perspectives are the same, this would 
date these elements of the list to 829. However, we have no particular guarentee that they 
are - the compiler may simply have compiled someone else's first-person experiences into their 
own work.</LI> 

<LI>The names of most of the Wonders are Old Welsh. But this doesn't mean the list was: 
placenames can be quite persistent under even relatively slight literacy. Nevertheless, 
relatively old forms like the "uu" in <I>Finnaun Guur Helic</I> might point to 
a date similar to that of the early versions of the Gododdin poem c.6th<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN> 
(See <A href="/history/otherWorks.html">Other&nbsp;Works</A>). The distribution of the 
Wonders suggests a British author at a time when the British had been pushed out of England, 
but still maintained a presence in the Scottish borders. This, however, might include all the 
above periods.</LI>

<LI>Most importantly, some of the Wonder descriptions include datable details: 
<A href="/wonder10/index.html">Wonder&nbsp;10</A> must have been written after or during the 
life of Saint Iltutus, who is said to have trained Gildas. Equally, 
<A href="/wonder11/index.html">Wonder&nbsp;11</A> must have been written during or after the 
lifetime of Mouric, which, if this is Saint Mouric, would imply a time after 547 
(A href="/wonder11/notes/dates.html" target=bottom>Note</A>).</LI>
</UL>
  
<P>
In short, the dating evidence is limited, but on balance probably suggests 
c.550 to 829.

What, then, is the purpose of the list.

1) Latin tradition

2) Pagan sites, augmented later: strange so little christian glossing - unlike later 
natural wonders which were used as illustrations of gods work.

Gregory(?) banning worship of natural places?? - or was this aimed at Saxons? 

Saxon Paganism.

Paganism in the Scottish borders - see 'Archaeology of ritual and magic".


Sounds ridiculous but:
	Irish examples.
	pAGAN Elements in list; eg. boar hunt
