Natural wonders have fascinated writers since Herodotus' 
<I><A href="http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.html" target=_new>Historia</A></I> (5th Century&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>BCE</SPAN>). Solinus' <I>De mirabilibus mundi</I> 
("Wonders of the world" : <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Julius_Solinus" target=_new>biography</A>) was well known in the medieval period<A href="../../references/Roberts1991Culhwch.html">*</A>. 
Nennius' represent an early British example of what was to become a significant 
trend in medieval writing: delight in the odd. For a crowning example of this 
trend, see Sir John Mandeville's 
(<A href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/John%20Mandeville">Biography/Discussion</A>)
<A href="http://www.romanization.com/books/mandeville/" target=_new>Travels</A>
