One could happily claim Nennius was the first native Geographer of Britain. While 
the first native geographical work by a Briton we have is probably the start of 
Gildas' (<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gildas" target=_new>Biography</A>) 
<I>De Excidio Britann(i)ae liber querulus</I> ("the Fall/Ruin/Capture of Britain, a 
book of whining": see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target="right">Other Works</A>), 
which describes the chief features of Britain (See 
Giles'<A href="../../references/Giles1891Six.html">*</A> translation of  
<A href="http://historymedren.about.com/library/text/bltxtgildas3to6.htm" target=_new>Chapter 3</A>), 
this is entirely derived from non-native sources, mainly 
Orosius<A href="../../references/Giles1891Six.html">*</A>, though ultimately the 
source is probably Caesar's <I>De Bellum Gallico</I> 
(<A href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=CaeComm.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=all" target=_new>Commentaries on the Gallic War</A>, especially caes.gal.5.13) 
which is potentially based in turn on the work of Pytheas 
(<A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>). 
Gildas' work is used in 
Bede (<A href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02384a.htm" target=_new>Biography</A>; 
<A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target="right">Other Works</A>), but, again, with nothing very 
original. Nennius' compilation of Wonders would certainly seem to be the first 
native Geographical description, and, more than the others, Nennius actually goes 
beyond a mere introduction to the layout of the land, to look at 
the manner in which it works. The earliest <I>suggested</I> native geographical 
work would be the measuring of the land by Dyfnwal "Moelmut" ("the bald and 
silent"; elsewhere given responsiblity for the first British "Molmutine" Laws), which is suggested in some versions of the Welsh Laws [<A href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html">*</A>note for line 254].
