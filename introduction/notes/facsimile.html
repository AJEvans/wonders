<P>
This writing is from the start of the historical section of the text that includes the 
Wonders, the <I>Historia Brittonum</I>, and is taken from 
Manuscript <A href="../../history/manuscripts.html#A" target=right>A</A>, widely considered to 
the oldest copy of the <I>Historia</I>. In full, the first 
line is "<I>Brittannia insula a quod[am] bruto consule romano dicta</I>" ("The Island of Britain is called after one Brutus, a Roman consul"). 
The text is from a facsimile given by Stevenson<A href="../../references/Stevenson1838Nennius.html">*</A>. You can see the 
other facsimiles he gives  on the <A href="../../history/manuscripts.html" target=right>Manuscripts</A> page.
