The identification of wonders 21-24 as the separate "Wonders of Mona" comes from 
the manuscripts <A href="../../history/manuscripts.html#K" target=right>K(2)</A> 
and <A href="../../history/manuscripts.html#L" target=right>L</A> (appears derived from K), both of which have the inserted title in red 
<I>de mirabilibus monie insule</I><A href="../../references/Mommsen1894Historia.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(Gill<A href="../../references/Gill1939Man.html" target=bottom>*</A> notes this also of the "Royal MS" [? there are several]). 
The Irish versions have <I>Inganta Manann Ann So Sis [Modern: Anseo S&iacute;os]</I><A href="../../references/Todd1848Leabhar.html" target=bottom>*</A> ["The Wonders of Manann Down Here" i.e. listed below(?)].  
</P>
<P>
The contents 
list (c.1543&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>) in  
Manuscript <A href="../../history/manuscripts.html#C" target=right>C</A> lists these wonders as <I>De mirabilibus Monie insule, quo Anglice Engleseie 
vocatur, id est insula Anglorum</I><A href="../../references/Morris1980Nennius.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
["The Wonders of the Isle of Monie, which in English is called Engleseie, 
that is the Island of the Englishmen"] (the etymology is probably wrong). 
Strangely, Wonders 2 to 13 are also labelled <I>De mirabilibus Monae insulae</I> in 
Morris' Latin text<A href="../../references/Morris1980Nennius.html" target=bottom>*</A>, however, this is in parentheses, and it is not clear where this label came from.

Initially these sites were identified as being on the Isle of Man (at least since 
Moore<A href="../../references/Moore1891Man.html" target=bottom>*</A> and 
Mommsen<A href="../../references/Mommsen1894Historia.html" target=bottom>*</A> [Zimmer?<A href="../../references/Mommsen1894Historia.html" target=bottom>*</A>]). 
However Gill<A href="../../references/Gill1939Man.html" target=bottom>*</A>, without any apparent knowledge of the contents list, identified 
the location as the Isle of Anglesey. His reason for this was largely the somewhat weak evidence 
that <A href="../../wonder24/index.html" target=right>Wonder&nbsp;24</A> could be the island's <I>Maen&nbsp;Morddwyd</I>, though he does 
invoke the more convincing <I>Mene</I> = <I>Menai</I> identity and note that the whirlpool <I>Cereuus</I> is probably 
<I>Pwll&nbsp;Ceris</I> in the Menai Straits. He notes Llwyd<A href="../../references/Llwyd1833Mona.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
had claimed the wonders for Anglesey a century before. The confusion arises because of the similarity of Latin names 
<I>Mona</I>: Anglesey (<I>Ynys M&ocirc;n</I> in Welsh) and <I>Monapia</I>/<I>Monaoeda Insula</I>: Man (See, for various 
sources:<A href="../../references/White2004Mona.html" target=bottom>*</A>).
</P>
<P>
Wandering stones (<A href="../../wonder24/index.html" target=right>Wonder&nbsp;24</A>) are not unusual, and raised 
beaches (<A href="../../wonder21/index.html" target=right>Wonder&nbsp;21</A>) are more 
common on Man than Anglesey, however the names are strongly indicative of Anglesey: at best the inhabitants of Man might argue for 
our list being confusedly constructed from both a Man and Anglesey list prior to inclusion in the <I>Historia</I>, but the length of 
this section of the wonders makes this somewhat unlikely.
