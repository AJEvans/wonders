The History is extant in ~35 Latin manuscripts and a few in Irish<A href="../../references/Morris1980Nennius.html">*</A>. You can find fuller details of the manuscripts and links to translations on the  
<A href="../../history/manuscripts.html" target="right">manuscripts page</a>, however, good 
sites include the attempt by Keith Matthews of Leicester University to 
reconstruct an 
<A href="http://www.kmatthews.org.uk/history/gildas/frames.html" target="_new">archetypal&nbsp;<I>Historia</I></A> (Latin) by piecing together manuscripts 
detailed by Theodor Mommsen, and the English 
<A href="http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100028/index.html" target=_new>translation</a> 
of the Irish version of the 
<I>Historia</I> which includes the Wonders.</P>
