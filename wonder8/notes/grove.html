Craig Chapman<A href="../../references/Chapman67Groves.html">*</A> notes  
that Richmond and Crawford (1949) suggested on the basis of Nennius' wonder that the 
location "Nemetambala" noted in the Ravenna Cosmography 
(See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>), was near the 
end of the Wye. They suggested the end of the name could be a mis-transcription of <I>abala</I> 
which would make the name mean "sacred apple grove". Chapman<A href="../../references/Chapman67Groves.html">*</A> suggests it is actually <I>ambala</I>, the Greek for shield boss, making the name mean "sacred grove at the world's centre". However, 
Keith Matthews, who maintains a well researched 
<A href="http://users.breathe.com/kmatthews/RB_placenames.html" target=_new>list of Dark Age/Roman placenames</A> suggests the text actually 
reads "Nemetobala" and refers to
