The <I>Larousse Gastronomique</I><A href="../../references/Montagne2001Larousse.html">*</A> notes under <I>Cervoise</I> 
("Barley Beer") that the Gaul's <I>Cerevisia</I> was probably named by combining the 
name of the Roman Goddess of crops <I>Cer&egrave;s</I> with the Latin for "strength" <I>Vis</I>. 
The name continues in the Iberian words for beer: <I>Cerveja</I> and <I>Cerveza</I>.  
Note also that while it lists the ingredients of <I>Cervoise</I> (a proto-beer made before the 
14th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN> introduction of hops) as barley, oats, rye or wheat, and spices, it notes legislation in 1268&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN> by the <I>Livre des M&eacute;tiers</I> banning the addition of berries, honey-sweetened spiced wine 
and resin - a list into which Sorbs would fit without particularly looking unusual.
