As it turns out, the Service Trees do best with a little bit of oak 
shade to start with, so Cadbury planted five True Service Trees:  
three some time around the 1950s, and two 
(three?<A href="../references/JenningsWBRCSorb.html" target=bottom>*</A>) in the 1980s within a few 
metres of a log cabin he built in the woods. 
The two saplings are doing well (12 Sept 2005: 
<A href="photos/wyre-sapling1.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>, 
<A href="photos/wyre-sapling2.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>), but we could only see one 
of the older triplets, which was tall but somewhat thin 
(<A href="photos/wyre-tree.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>).
The tree does, indeed, look like an Ash 
(<A href="photos/wyre-leaves1.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A> 
<A href="photos/wyre-leaves2.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>).

The growth rate is 
low, with 50 years being perhaps 12 inches (30 cm) diameter.  
The forester said the tree fruited very rarely - he'd seen it flower 
and fruit the two years after he started working there, which was during a drought summer  
when other trees were dying off. He'd collected 
some fruits, which were like those of the Wild Service Tree 
(which he has growing in his garden: 
<A href="photos/wyre-wildleaves.html" class=photo>Leaves</A> 
and <A href="photos/wyre-wildfruit.html" class=photo>Fruit</A> [12 Sept 2005]), 
but about twice the size (maybe about 2cm) and more pear-shaped.
He suggested the tree was rare, but not as rare as 
most make out, with more growing on the forestry land at the 
back of Withybed Wood, as well as Wild Service Trees.

You can easily get to the mature tree. Leaving Button Oak towards 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-2.31700&GridN=52.37560&lon=-2.31700&lat=52.37560&search_result=Bewdley%2CWorcestershire&db=freegaz&cidr_client=none&lang=&place=Bewdley,Worcestershire&pc=&advanced=&client=public&addr2=&quicksearch=Bewdley&addr3=&scale=100000&addr1=" target=_new class=place>Bewdley</A>, 
park in the Forestry Commission carpark about 500m 
into the wood on the left. Walk back up the road towards 
Button Oak on the opposite side. Just before the first house 
on the left there is a (private) gate, and just before this a stile. 
Go over the stile and follow the path to the road associated with the gate. 
Follow the road down to a rough T-junction and take the 
left road. Follow this down some 300m where you'll see the rough track 
on the right to the cabin. Don't follow this private road, instead 
keep going another 500m down the road to a point where the 
ground on the right slopes off steeply. The tree is some 5m down the 
slope.
