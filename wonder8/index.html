"Near the river, which is named the Guoy, apples are found upon Ash trees in a sloping woodland [or pass], at the mouth of the river."<SUP><A href="notes/translation.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>

<P>
These marvellous trees apparently grew somewhere near the mouth of 
the River <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=325000.226465842&Y=200000.213026418&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=500000&right.x=5&right.y=18" target=_new class=place>Wye</A> 
(the <I>Gwy</I><SUP><A href="notes/wye.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>). 
Marc Hampton has suggested, plausibly, that this is the True Service 
Tree<A href="../references/Roper2003Goas.html" target=bottom>*</A><SUP><A href="notes/sorbus.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP>, 
which does, indeed, have leaves like the related Mountain Ash, and bears Apple-like fruits 
(sorbs)<SUP><A href="notes/sorbs.html" target=bottom>4</A></SUP>. In the past these have 
been used to make a cider-like drink<A href="../references/Worcestershire2004Trueservice.html" target=bottom>*</A>.

<P>The tree still grows in this area<SUP><A href="notes/habitat.html" target=bottom>5</A></SUP>, but is rare. Notably, 
it seems that the tree is competed-out of normal woodland, and only thrives on very 
steep limestone slopes<A href="../references/ClaxtonWBRCWhitty.html" target=bottom>*</A> where other trees have difficulties.
