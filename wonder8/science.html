The "True Service Tree" or "Whitty Pear" is <I>Sorbus domestica L.</I>. 
You can find a photo of it <A href="http://www.biopix.dk/Photo.asp?Language=en-us&PhotoId=14991" target=_new>here</A> or in the <A href="wyre.html">Visit Details</A>. A detailed description of its 
history, uses and range can be found in Jennings<A href="../references/JenningsWBRCSorb.html" target=bottom>*</A> and 
Claxton<A href="../references/ClaxtonWBRCWhitty.html" target=bottom>*</A>. The tree is 
not actually an Ash (<I>Fraxinus</I>), but a close relative of the Rowan (<I>Sorbus aucuparia</I>, the 
so-called "Mountain Ash"), 
and is a member of the Rose (<I>Rosaceae</I>) family. Other close relations, which bear similar fruit 
but look nothing like Ash, include the Wild Service tree 
(<I>Sorbus torminalis</I>) and the Apples/Crabapples (<I>Malus</I>).

The tree is probably one of the rarest that might, potentially, be indigenous to Britain. 
There are, apparently, 
only 23 mature wild examples currently known in 
Britain<A href="../references/ClaxtonWBRCWhitty.html" target=bottom>*</A> and it is one of the 
most endangered species of tree in the country with a plethora of plans being developed 
to preserve it<A href="../references/ClaxtonWBRCWhitty.html" target=bottom>*</A><A href="../references/Worcestershire2004Sorbusdomestica.html" target=bottom>*</A>.

<P>It seems likely the tree was rare even when our list was compiled - why 
compare it with the common Ash if everyone had seen it? 
Patrick Roper<A href="../references/Roper2003Goas.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
has suggested the tree is a Roman introduction, and this doesn't seem an unreasonable conjecture  
as they used it elsewhere to make drink (see <A href="myth.html">Myth</A>). Whatever the truth 
of that possibility, it certainly appears that the tree is reluctant to propagate by seed under the 
current British climate. For example, the concentration of trees in the Wyre Forest area are mostly   
cuttings from one lone specimen, first mentioned in 
1677<A href="../references/JenningsWBRCSorb.html" target=bottom>*</A>/8<A href="../references/ClaxtonWBRCWhitty.html" target=bottom>*</A><SUP><A 
href="notes/court.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>. 
That said, it seems the tree can last at least 400 years, sometimes propagating 
by root<A href="../references/JenningsWBRCSorb.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
and the British climate has changed a fair amount since the list was put together.
