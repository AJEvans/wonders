One has to wonder why such a perculiar, rare, and difficult tree 
(see <A href="science.html">Science</A>) has come down to us at all.  
Patrick Roper<A href="../references/Roper2003Goas.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
has suggested the tree might have had "mystical associations" 
in the Dark Ages, and it has been suggested it grew in 
"sacred groves"<SUP><A href="notes/grove.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>, however, 
a more likely reason is the magical power of booze. It appears the Sorbs 
can be used to make a drink known to the Romans as <I>cevevisia</I><SUP><A href="notes/cevevisia.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP> 
(hence the name)<A href="../references/JenningsWBRCSorb.html" target=bottom>*</A><A href="../../references/Worcestershire2004Trueservice.html" target=bottom>*</A> and 
Fred Jennings<A href="../references/JenningsWBRCSorb.html" target=bottom>*</A> has suggested that 
this, and the drink's use in augmenting mead, may account for the tree's survival 
and spread. In Germany, schnapps is still produced from the sorbs<A href="../references/Worcestershire2004Trueservice.html" target=bottom>*</A>.

None-the-less, most trees have attracted a folklore to them, and this tree is 
no exception. For those following the modern delight with things Templar, apparently they 
made their staffs from this tree<A href="../references/Worcestershire2004Sorbusdomestica.html" target=bottom>*</A>, while in the Wyre Forest, where it was known as "wichen", 
sprigs from the tree were thought to act as talismen against 
evil spirits<A href="../references/JenningsWBRCSorb.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
It is, of course, possibly the tree has picked up (or been responsible for) some of the supernatural 
connections of the Mountain Ash.
