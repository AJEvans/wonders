It isn't especially clear where "the aforementioned region" refers to. The reference is from a British manuscript, which skip wonders 15-20. This would imply the wonder was in the same location as 
<A href="../../wonder14/index.html" target=right>wonder&nbsp;14</A>, i.e. Ceredigion. There is actually a very nice raised beach around 
much of Cardigan Bay which is very well known and distinct. Under other 
circumstances it would be an obvious choice for an unlocated 
raised-beach wonder. However, manuscript K and its derivative L both 
headline this section with a <I>de mirabilibus monie insule</I>, 
suggesting Anglesey (<A href="../../introduction/notes/mona.html" target=bottom>Note</A>). Although this doesn't appear to be the 
case for G (or, at least, it isn't mentioned in published sources), 
G was copied from the Durham manuscript, which was, in turn influenced by K. This may suggest the region referred to is "Mona".

Note that in at least one Irish manuscript Wonders <A href="../../wonder21/index.html" target=right>21</A> 
and <A href="../../wonder23/index.html" target=right>23</A> (which appear next to each other in the Irish versions, 
<A href="../../wonder22/index.html" target=right>22</A> being missing) are conflated into "A shore without a sea, i.e. a ford/shallow far from the sea"<A href="../../references/Gill1939Man.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
