This short wonder appears to refer to a raised beach. Raised beaches are beach material deposited on the land when sea levels were higher, relatively. They 
often appear as beaches left high and dry away from the current shoreline. The usual causes are the massive weight of ice pushing the land down below sea level during glaciations, or 
higher temperatures melting land-ice like glaciers, raising the sea level. However, the picture is complicated by the response of 
local geology to these forces. The best raised beaches in Britain are probably those at <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jura,_Scotland" target=_new>Jura</A> 
(<A href="http://www.scottishgeology.com/outandabout/classic_sites/locations/jura.html" target=_new>Details and Picture</A>). There are some great raised beaches on 
the <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_man" target=_new>Isle of Man</A>, which might be one reason for locating the "Mona" wonders 
there<SUP><A href="../introduction/notes/mona.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP>. However, there are at least two good raised beaches on 
Anglesey: one at <A href="http://www.multimap.com/maps/?qs=Red+Wharfe+Bay+&countryCode=GB&mapData=904" target=_new class=place>Red&nbsp;Wharfe&nbsp;Bay</A> 
at 3m above current sea level<A href="../references/Talbot2008Geology.html" target=bottom>*</A>, and one at 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/maps/?qs=Anglesey&countryCode=GB&mapData=904&lon=-4.33333&lat=53.25000&zoom=14&moveMap=-400,1000" target=_new class=place>Ynys&nbsp;Llanddwyn</A> at about the same height 
(<A href="http://www.geomon.org.uk/about.htm" target=_new>Photo and details</A>). The Red Wharfe Bay beach seems like a likely candidate as it apparently sits 
distinct on the top of a limestone platform, though Ynys&nbsp;Llanddwyn is near other wonders.
