You can think of the impressive front of the bore as a change of 
behaviour on the tide's behalf. Tidal waters are being 
forced into river water (and the water from the end of the 
last tide) travelling in the opposite 
direction towards the sea faster than either water can 
reverse direction. A mass of water therefore 
it builds up. Because it can't push upstream fast 
enough, the pressure behind it causes it to change form into one 
that can ride over the riverwater and rapidly make up the distance 
it has lost (release the pressure behind it). The form largely depends on how deep the 
tide is relative to the river water it is overrunning<SUP><A href="notes/form.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>. 
The drawings below show three different forms, with tidal height increasing left to right...

<BR><I class=figureCaption>Three types of bore a) Undular jump: river water moves undulates through the bore. b) Weak 
jump: river largely flows under the ramp, but in places at the front curls back in turbulence to 
give small waves c) Steady Jump: The river leaves the bed in jets which run up through the interior of 
the ramp, with much surface turbulence (after Lynch<A href="../references/Lynch1982Tidal.html" target=bottom>*</A>).</I>
