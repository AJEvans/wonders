The form of the bore is likely to be related partly to the relative depths of the water bodies, 
and partly the energy in both. The structure can be related to the <I>Froude number</I> which is 
the square root of the ratio between the kinetic energy in the bore water and the 
gravitational energy in the waves on the bore (where the Froude number is &gt;1 the 
water is supercritical [See Note on <A href="critical.html">Bore&nbsp;Formation</A>]).
There is a relationship between these and the 
wave speed on and infront of the bore, and because of the relationship between the wave 
speeds and water depth, the number can also represent the square root of the ratio of the depth 
of the bore water by the depth of the river. 
For the diagram given the Froude numbers are (left to right) 1.0-1.7, 1.7-2.5 and 4.5-9.0. Essentially 
above 1.5 the bore has a turbulent, breaking front<A href="../../references/Chanson2004Mixing.html">*</A>, 
while above 2.5 the river rises up from the bed in jets of varying intensity, and the bore surface is 
highly turbulent<A href="../../references/Lynch1982Tidal.html">*</A>.
