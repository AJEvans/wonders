Bores are still fairly poorly understood scientifically. The best introductory paper  is Lynch<A href="../../references/Lynch1982Tidal.html">*</A>, but 
this is not available online.  
</P>
<P>
Good <I>online</I> scientific introductions to waves and bores are  
Tomczak<A href="../../references/Tomczak2000Introduction.html">*</A>, 
Mytton<A href="../../references/MyttonOxfordWaves.html">*</A> or 
Cramer<A href="../../references/Cramer2004Breaking.html">*</A><A href="../../references/Cramer2004Tsunamis.html">*</A>. 
For a detailed look at bores in particular, see Chason<A href="../../references/DonnellyChanson2002Impact.html">*</A><A href="../../references/Chanson2004Tidal.html">*</A>.

<P>
The major scientific papers on how bores work are Abbott<A href="../../references/Abbott1956Theory.html">*</A>, 
who models the Severn bore; LeBlond<A href="../../references/LeBlond1978Tidal.html">*</A> who arques that 
bores are best not thought of as waves, but as a diffusion of material upstream; Mazumder and Bose<A href="../../references/MazumderBose1995Formation.html">*</A>, who look at the relationship between bore formation 
and the presence of old tidal water in the river; and Donnelly and Chanson<A href="../../references/DonnellyChanson2002Impact.html">*</A> who examine the movement of water inside 
bores with physcial models and report on previous fieldwork.
