Bores don't actually form at the highest tide, but somewhere between the tide turn and 
the middle of the rise<A href="../../references/MazumderBose1995Formation.html">*</A><A href="../../references/Abbott1956Theory.html">*</A>, when the change in water height is at its fastest. This suggests 
it is smaller waves on the tide surface that 'pick away' at the building tide until 
it converts to a bore and rushes upstream.
