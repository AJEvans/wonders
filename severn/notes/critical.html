Horizontal water movement in a wave is usually 
less than the wavelength (tides, which are waves, only 
move water inland because their wavelengths are very long). 
At the place bores form however, the horizontal water movement 
in waves gets further and further, as the crests get higher and faster   
relative to the bed. Eventually the water starts to move 
horizontally and a bore forms in which the water movement is horizontal at the speed 
of the bore<A href="../../references/DonnellyChanson2002Impact.html">*</A> 
(that is, <I>supercritical</I>: moving at the speed of local waves, carrying them 
along, rather than <I>subcritical</I> where waves move across the water). 
This is a much more efficient and speedy way of distributing the 
tidewater than the standard tide wave, which is butressed by the 
water in the river. However, the bore can look wave-like. This is partly 
a surface expression of regular structures within the bore caused 
by the river water trying to escape through 
it<A href="../../references/Lynch1982Tidal.html">*</A> (see 
<A href="../science4.html" target=right>Bore Structure</A>), 
but the fact that the bore rises when the river depth 
drops<A href="../../references/Abbott1956Theory.html">*</A> suggests a   
more traditional wave-nature. 
Because of this, the bore can have a complex relationship with the 
tidal waters (see evidence quoted in Chanson<A href="../../references/Chanson2004Mixing.html">*</A>).
