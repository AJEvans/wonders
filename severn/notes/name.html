The word "bore" is from the Old Norse <I>bara</I> meaning a wave or swell. An alternative term in 
England is "Aegir" (pronounced "eeger"), after the Norse god of the sea, though this is only really commonly 
used in reference to the Trent Aegir, information on which can be found via 
the Note on <A href="rivers.html">British&nbsp;Bores</A>.
