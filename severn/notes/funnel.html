The funnelling shape of the Severn estuary means the tide can build 
to a depth higher than it otherwise might as, broadly, more water 
enters the estuary than can spread in it at the same level. This is increased 
again by tidally enhanced <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_resonance" target=_new>resonance</A> in the Bristol 
channel<A href="../../references/Flather2001Climate.html">*</A>. Lynch<A href="../../references/Lynch1982Tidal.html">*</A> notes that globally some 70% of 
rivers with bores on them have mouths that experience tidally enhanced resonance. 
Finally, in shallow estuaries waves build in height to keep the amount of energy in 
the system the same<A href="../../references/Cramer2004Breaking.html">*</A><A href="../../references/Cramer2004Tsunamis.html">*</A> as the surrounding water shallows. In total then, with a shallow funnelling estuary with 
tidally-enhanced resonance, the Severn is well set up for a high tidal bore wave.
