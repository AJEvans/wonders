Sometimes, the bore can appear as a number of small waves (an undular bore) , or as a major, 
breaking, wave, or a mix of breaking waves at the shallow, high friction banks and undular 
bore in the deeper middle<A href="../../references/Lynch1982Tidal.html">*</A>. 
Sometimes the water behind can be much higher than 
the water upstream, so the wave is like a step. Because of this height difference 
the flow of the water, which is off the front of the bore under gravity, reverses 
the general flow of the river, with the river running, essentially, uphill<A href="../../references/DonnellyChanson2002Impact.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
