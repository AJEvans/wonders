So what is going on inside the bore?

When a normal beach wave breaks, water rushes up the beach as a foaming mass. 
Waves 'break' because in water that is shallow relative to distance 
between waves, their speed is related to the depth to 
the bed. This means that in very shallow water 
the wave tops (crests) are moving much faster than the troughs between them<A href="../../references/MyttonOxfordWaves.html">*</A><A href="../../references/Tomczak2000Introduction.html">*</A>. 
The crest overtakes the trough infront and it crashes down. Waves are more like patterns superimposed on water than actual water movements. The water 
in them usually moves back and forth less than the distance between waves. 
However, when a wave breaks, there is enough momentum in the crest water 
for it to rush up the beach as a turbulent mass.

River bores form by similar processes<SUP><A href="notes/critical.html" target=bottom>1</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/formation.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>. Because they have 
more water in them, they look more sedate, but the 
turbulence below the surface allows the river water to interfinger with 
the tide water in complex structures. These structures also allow them 
to swallow up the water surface irregularities that would normally mess 
up waves, and they can therefore run huge distances up river<A href="../references/Chanson2001Flow.html" target=bottom>*</A><A href="../references/DonnellyChanson2002Impact.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
