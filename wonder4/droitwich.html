Droitwich still has much of the salt-town about it, particually around Lido Park. 
While the park salt-lido has closed 
(for the moment: <A href="http://www.savedroitwichlido.org/" target=_new>info</A>) there is a new 
theraputic pool (<A href="http://www.brinebath.co.uk/" target=_new>info</A>) in the town 
(<A href="photos/droitwich-newpool.html" class=photo>Photo</A>: apologies for the state of the 
photos - it was the worst of days for photography, not least because it was snowing ten to the dozen). The park ponds 
claim to be saline on at least one map, though this seems a little 
dubious (it has to be said that the thought of testing them isn't 
particually tempting, even with the combined weight of past antiquarians 
jeering behind you).

The original salt industry and the probable site of our wonder, however, was down by the current canal in Vines 
Park, in the Salwerp Valley (<A href="photos/droitwich-location.html" class=photo>Photo</A>). 
Pretty much alone amongst all the wonders, the local community has actually highlighted 
the presence of this place in the <I>Historia</I>, and has gone to the effort of 
restoring a salt tank on the original site (<A href="photos/droitwich-tank.html" class=photo>Photo</A>) 
despite the apparent dangers (<A href="photos/droitwich-danger.html" class=photo>Photo</A>)!

You can find a description of the salt industry, and the 
techniques it used <A href="http://www.lionsaltworkstrust.co.uk/history_heritage.html" target=_new>here</A>.
