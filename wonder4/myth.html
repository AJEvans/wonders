<P>
Although salt springs are sometimes used for salt production, they 
often have a dual use. Salt springs have long been considered good for you - perhaps because 
cattle liked them, or their effect on wounds and pests, 
or just because of their strangeness. Even before the  
exploitation of salt springs in baths like those at Droitwich or Llandrindod the waters 
were taken by local people. Camden<A href="../references/Camden1607Britannia.html" target=bottom>*</A>, writing in 1607, notes in <A href="http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/shropseng.html" target=_new>Shroppshire</A>...

"Croke ... within a while after visiteth Middlewich, neere unto his confluence with Dan, where there bee two wells of salt water parted one from the other by a small broke, Sheathes they call them: the one stands not open, but at certaine set times, because folke willingly steale the water thereof, as beeing of greater vertue and efficacie."
