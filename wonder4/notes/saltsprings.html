Plainly records of salt springs known in the 'Dark Age' are limited. 
The earliest comprehensive list is the Domesday Book (1086&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>) which 
lists inland salt production at Droitwich, the Wich in the Hundred of Warmundestrou (Nantwich), Northwich, Middlewich and the now lost manor of Burwardestone(?Fulwich) (probably 
<A href="http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/FLN/Whitewell/" target=_new>Whitewell / Iscoyd</A> in Flintshire)<A href="../../references/Twigg2002Salt.html">*</A>. The Saxon name 
"wich" <I>may</I> denote a salt-works (certainly by 1607 this was 
believed by Camden, who suggests the people of this area, then known as the <I>"Wiccii"</I>, got their 
name from "wiccj", meaning a salt pit<A href="../../references/Bloch1996Etymology .html">*</A> [though it seems to be transcribed as 
<A href="http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/warkseng.html#worcs1" target=_new><I>wiches</I></A> 
in the version (with additions) by Philemon Holland<A href="../../references/Camden1607Britannia.html">*</A>]). There 
is evidence of the four "wichs" around Chester<A href="../../references/Twigg2002Salt.html">*</A>, and 
Droitwich<A href="../../references/AnonDroitwichHistory.html">*</A>, being used 
from the Iron Age onwards. Other likely candidates would be the saline springs at Llandrindod Wells, apparently known 
to the Romans as <I>Balnea/s Siluri/a</I> (Baths of the Silurians [~Welsh])<A href="../../references/AnonLlandrindodSpa.html">*</A>, though flow here is low<A href="../../references/EdmundsRobinsShand1998Saline.html">*</A> and the wells at Purton Stoke or Wootton Bassett, both of which are saline<A href="../../references/Jordan2001Wiltshire.html">*</A>, and 
nearer Bath, but for which there is no ancient historical record other than them being "traditional".
