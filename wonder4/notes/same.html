<P>The "same" either refers to 
the Hot Pool or the territory of the Hwicce. If "same" refers to the Pool, we must look elsewhere for our Hot Pool, as the pool at Bath is not currently saline enough to be noticed as "salty" 
(See <A href="../../wonder3/index.html" target=right>The Third Wonder</A> Note on  
<A href="../../wonder3/notes/bristol.html">Hotwells</A> for one possibility that might be dismissed). If it refers to the territory of the Hwicce, and we accept that this is essentially 
the area now covered by the old diocese of 
Worcester<A href="../../references/Manco1998Bath.html">*</A>, 
then Droitwich, as suggested by Sims<A href="../../references/SimsEBKBattling.html">*</A>, seems likely. Though "fountain" would seem an exagerated 
translation of what would have largely been saline pools (See Note on <A href="springs.html">Springs</A> for a discussion of 
this and the Note on <A href="saltsprings.html">Salt&nbsp;Springs</A> for other candidates).
