"Salt Springs" may seem a more likely translation, but "fountains" has some justification. The translation (see Note on 
<A href="translation.html">Translation</A> and <A href="alternatives.html">Alternatives</A>) 
of the Irish <I>tobar</I> as "fountain" in the Färber &amp; Irwin<A href="../../references/FarberIrwin2002English.html">*</A> edition  
seems a little over the top - today, for example, it would accept "Well" (elsewhere they translate <I>tipra/tibra</I> as "Well"), or even "Spring"<A href="../../references/Jones1954Wells.html">*</A>. Morris'<A href="../../references/Morris1980Nennius.html">*</A> translation of the Latin <I>font.es/ibus</I> to "spring" is more reserved, though "fountain" would have been possible, and, indeed 
Philemon Holland makes that translation in his version of  
Camden's<A href="../references/Camden1607Britannia.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
<A href="http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/warkseng.html#worcs1" target=_new>Worcestershire</A> 
for Droitwich 
<Q>where three fountaines yeelding plenty of water to make salt of</Q> (Camden gives <I>"ubi tres fontes gignendo sale foecundi"</I>). That springs can be strong enough to "erupt", even through a pond, there is no doubt - 
for example, Thomas<A href="../../references/Thomas2004Sacred.html">*</A> suggests the spring at 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=265000&Y=217500&width=500&height=300&gride=260957.352873637&gridn=218028.225889367&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=50000&multimap.x=182&multimap.y=182" class=place>Llandyfan</A> pond ("St Dyfan's well") does so - but there is limited evidence for this 
associated with any salt springs. 
In the unlikely event that the Irish text is older, and 
"fountain" more approprate, it is possible this refers to a 
marine blow-hole, such as that at Worm's Head, 
Gower, but this matches 
the Latin versions very badly, as these would be coastal and 
unsuitable places to attempt any kind of cooking!
