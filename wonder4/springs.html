Likely that many Spas arose around springs only found when 
mining entered the areas - some are geothermal, for example.

Also, in worcestershire:
 Tenbury Wells

 'wich' part of the name is the Anglo Saxon for 'salt town'.

Droitwich reference:

as also Leamington (so called of Leame a small brooke that wandereth through this part of the shire), where there boileth out a spring of salt water,
http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/warkseng.html

Then Newnham Regis, that is, Kings Newenham, standing upon the other side of the river, where three fountaines walme out of the ground streined, as it should seeme, though a veine of Alum, the water whereof, carrying both colour and taste of milke, is reported to cure the stone. Certes, it procureth urine abundantly, greene wounds it quickly closeth up and healteth, being drunke with salt it looseth, and with suger, bindeth the belly.

There adjoyneth unto this Bakewell upon the same riveret, which among these hils maketh it selfe way into Derwent. This was by the Saxons called Baddecanwell, and Marianus writeth that King Edward the Elder erected there a Burrough. Now whether it borrowed this name or no of the hote waters, which the ancient Englishmen, as also the Germans in their language termed bade and baden, whence came Baden in Germany and Buda in Hungarie, I know not. Certes, at the spring head of Wie not farre from hence there rise and walme up nine fountaines of hote waters, the place at this day is called Buxton Well, which being found by experience holsome for the stomach, sinewes, and the whole bodie, George Earle of Shrewsbury lately beautified with buildings, and so they are begunne againe to bee restored unto by concourse of the greatest gentlemen and of the nobility. At which time, that most unfortunately Lady Mary Queene of Scots bad farewell unto Buxton with this Distichon, by a little change of Caesars verses concerning Feltria,  in this wise:

Buxton, that of great name shalt be of hote and holsome baine [bath],
Farewell, for I perhaps shall not thee ever see againe.

9. But that these hote waters were knowen in old time, the port-way or High paved street named Bath-gate, reaching for seven miles together from here unto Burgh a little village doth manifestly shew.
