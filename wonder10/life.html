The 12th C. "Life of Saint Illtud"<A href="../references/WadeEvans1944Vitae.html" target=bottom>*</A> gives his life story thus: born in Brittany , the son of Bicanus, a warrior, and Rieingulid ("modest queen"), 
daughter of Anblaud ["Amlawd"<SUP><A href="../wonder13/genealogy/amlawd.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>] the king of Brittannie [Britain? Brittany?], 
he married Trynihid and then left for Britain. He ran the household of Poulentus, king of Glamorgan, 
until, while hunting, the rest of the household were swallowed by the earth for demanding food from Saint Cadog 
(<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/cadog.html" target=_new>Life</A>)<SUP><A href="life/cadog.html" target=bottom>2</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="life/swallowed.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP>. Illtud converted, 
and was visited by an angel in a dream on the banks of the Naudauan, and told to leave 
his wife and live the religious life. Looking at his wife naked, he realised the worthlessness of 
carnal relationships, and settled in the Hodnant<SUP><A href="life/hodnant.html" target=bottom>4</A></SUP>, setting up an oratory and school where he saw a family of pigs<SUP><A href="life/pigs.html" target=bottom>5</A></SUP>, while 
under penance for his lifestyle, imposed by Dubricius, bishop of Llandaff.
</P>
<P>
The king of the area, Meirchion the Wild<SUP><A href="life/meirchion.html" target=bottom>6</A></SUP>, chased a stag to the church, which instantly domesticated to draw 
carts etc. for Illtud<SUP><A href="../wonder11/notes/stags.html" target=bottom>7</A></SUP>. Meirchion demanded a meal and wine - but when given fish and water 
it tasted miraculously of diverse 
tastes<SUP><A href="life/food.html" target=bottom>8</A></SUP>. An angel visited the king telling him to let Illud keep the land and 
he confirmed the land as Illtud's. Illtud's school grew, and he trained the Saints Samson, Paulinus, Gildas and David<SUP><A href="life/students.html" target=bottom>9</A></SUP>.
Illud is then given the title of Abbot.
</P>
<P>
The sea threatened to flood the valley by a wave which "swelled beyond measure" up the river<SUP><A href="life/wave.html" target=bottom>10</A></SUP>. 
He built a dike, which was destroyed three times, before he drove the sea back to the shore.  
There he made a fresh-water spring flow with his staff<SUP><A href="life/fountains.html" target=bottom>11</A></SUP> and set up a landing place.
</P>
<P>
Samson was training under Illtud when Illtud's corn was stolen. 
Samson miraculously herded into a barn to teach them a lesson.
Samson himself was asked to be Bishop of Dol, and cried so hard about leaving he cried a spring into existance in the upper Hondnant. 
After his death, his body was miraculously conveyed back to the Hodnant<SUP><A href="life/stones.html" target=bottom>12</A></SUP>.
</P>
<P>
Trynihid visited Illtud, and found him muddy from constant delving. Her request to talk with him left her blind, so improper was 
it - her sight was only returned by Illtud's prayers.
</P>
<P>
Cyflym, Meirchion's steward, a nasty bit of work, connived against the saint, and was melted like wax. Despite this 
Illud prayed for him. This caused Meirchion to turn against the saint. The saint hid on the banks of the Ewenny, 
in a secret cave<SUP><A href="life/caves.html" target=bottom>13</A></SUP>, where he stayed for a year and three days with a stone for a bed, living off divine food.
While hiding, a messenger carrying a bell from Gildas to David passed the cave<SUP><A href="life/bell.html" target=bottom>14</A></SUP>. The bell ran out, and Illud came out to marvel
at its quality. When it got to David it wouldn't ring for him, so he sent it back to Illtud. The messenger then told the 
monks where their Abbot was hidden. 
</P>
<P>
A steward, Cyfygydd, turned against the saint, and was swallowed by a marsh.
Meirchion, mad about this, went to kill Illtud, and was swallowed by the earth. Illtud was then visited by so many 
people that he retreated to the cave at Llwynarth for three years.
</P>
<P>
In the cave the wonder occurs. The description differs in four respects: 1) the body has a sweet smell; 2) the 
body is buried in the cave, and the alter hangs above it, 3) no church is set up and 4) the testing of the 
miracle is not mentioned, although it does mention that the altar was associated with miracles.
</P>
<P>
Two robbers took Illtud's swine, and escaped to the woods, but found that at dawn they were back at the sty. The 
next night they made for a mountain, but found themselves back there again. This time, they were turned into 
two stones<SUP><A href="life/petrify.html" target=bottom>15</A></SUP>.
</P>
<P>
Illtud visited Britanny. There the people were starving, and he miraculously called grain stored in Wales 
to the shore to feed people<SUP><A href="life/grain.html" target=bottom>16</A></SUP>. 
He returned to Britain, but, when his life was done, returned to Dol to 
be buried. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar, King of the English, stole Illtud's bell at put it round the neck of his horse. However, when 
preparing his troups afterwards he saw a man pierce his chest with a spear, though  no one else did. 
He asked for the bell to be returned, and the horses took it back. When they arrived at Illtud's church 
on the Taff, the bell fell to the floor and cracked a stone.
</P>
<P>
During the reign of William I, Glamorgan was held by the Normans. The Welsh attacked everyone, 
including the lands of Illtud's church. However, when they attacked, the people barracaded themselves 
in a fort made against the sea up a hill. They held off the night attack. During the attack, sparks 
flew between the church of saint Illtud and the fortress of king Meirchion.
