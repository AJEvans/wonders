Swansea Bay (<A href="photos/oystermouth-bay.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>) ends to the west with 
the Mumbles, an area including Oystermouth and the features which apparently gave the area its name 
(<A href="photos/knab-mumbles.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>). The latter include "Bob's Cave"
(you can see 
pictures of Bob's Cave <A href="http://www.explore-gower.co.uk/Content/pa=showpage/pid=12.html" target=_new>here</A>). 
</P>
<P>
Knab rock has now been built over, and the area protected with boulders as part of a slipway 
(<A href="photos/knab-rock.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>), though some of the original 
rock peeks through the concrete (<A href="photos/knab-nub.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>). If you are driving, you can park in 
a carpark a little up towards Swansea, and walk down to the Knab by heading towards the Mumbles, passing 
what appear to be old lime kilns 
(<A href="photos/knab-lime-kilns.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>). 

There's certainly room enough for a chapel by Knab Rock, though it is far from clear how much of the cliffline has 
been quarried away.

The rock-arch was in the area at the bottom of the slipway. You can still see 
a limb of it 
(<A href="photos/knab-arch1.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>;
<A href="photos/knab-arch2.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>; 
<A href="photos/knab-arch3.html" target=right class=photo>Panoramic</A> showing quarrying).
At least two images of the arch are in existence and can be found in 
Gabb<A href="../references/Gabb1986Mumbles.html" target=bottom>*</A> who 
notes (p.28) that the arch fell in a storm in 1910. The least exaggerated  
picture is from 1805. You can see it overlayed on the current remnants <A href="photos/knab-rock-overlay.html" target=right class=photo>here</A>.
</P>

In addition, there was (is?) apparently also a rock-arch on the middle "Mumble", one "Mumble" from Bob's Cave. You 
can see it on a postcard <A href="http://ourpasthistory.com/Gallery/album345/Mumbles_Lighthouse_Natural_Arch_Swansea_postmark_1905" target=_new class=photo>here</A>.
