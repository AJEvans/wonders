Hughes<A href="../references/Hughes1999Prehistoric.html" target=bottom>*</A> suggests the 
rock was originally 4&nbsp;x&nbsp;3&nbsp;x&nbsp;2.2&nbsp;m, weighing in at 24&nbsp;tons. She 
notes the legend recorded by Iolo Morganwg that the rock was split by St&nbsp;David to prove 
it was a Pagan altar - though Iolo had his own reasons for wanting this to be true 
and wasn't above falsifying folklore (See <A href="cetti.html" target=bottom>Note</A>).
