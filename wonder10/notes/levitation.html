The first definite representation of a hoop used as a magician's prop appears to 
be in Hieronymus Bosch's 
"<A href="http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/b/bosch/1early/11magici.html" target=_new>The Magician</A>" 
(1475-80), though it is far from clear what its purpose is (is it, for example, for the 
small decorated dog to jump through?). One potential use of larger hoops would be in acrobatics, 
as can be seen in a 16th C scene of conjurors by Pieter Bruegel (sadly not online, but 
can be found in Christopher<A href="../../references/Christopher1962Panorama.html" target=bottom>*</A>).

<P>
However, the history of the hoop-pass specifically is tied into the history of large-scale modern  
levitations, and the ties are so intimately it is hard to discuss one without the other. 
</P>
<P>
The first static and supported <I>suspension</I> of an assistant appears to be 
watchmaker 
Jean Eug&egrave;ne Robert-Houdin's 
(<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Eug%C3%A8ne_Robert-Houdin" target=_new>Biography</A>) "Ethereal Suspension" (1847), in which his son seemed to hover just supported on a single stick (<A href="http://www.illusionata.com/mpt/view.php?id=197&type=articles" target=_new>Description</A>; 
<A href="http://florida.com/magic/broom.htm" target=_new>Mechanism</A>; Though also see <A href="houdini.html" target=bottom>Note</A> 
on prior Indian illusions). There doesn't 
seem to be any evidence he used a hoop-pass with the trick, though the general complexity 
of some of his balances (boy on stick, on stool, on left end of a plank supported at the right end 
on a trellis<A href="../../references/Christopher1962Panorama.html" target=bottom>*</A>) would 
have ensured no additional proof was needed for effect.
</P>
<P>
The first free-floating and moving <I>levitation</I> of an assistant seems to originate with 
another watchmarker - John Nevil Maskelyne (<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Nevil_Maskelyne" target=_new>Biography</A>), who's complex "fan of wires" rig at the 
<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Hall" target=_new>Egyptian&nbsp;Hall</A> in London 
took weeks to set up<A href="../../references/Genii2003Kellar.html" target=bottom>*</A>. Maskelyne probably picked up the idea of levitations from the Spiritualist 
"Davenport Brothers" (<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davenport_Brothers" target=_new>Biography</A>). The Davenports started out in 1854 conducted seances in the dark, in which people 
would reach up into the darkness and touch their shoes and clothes as they flew by<A href="../../references/Christopher1962Panorama.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
They later moved to being tied up and locked in a cabinet and inducing spirits to levitate 
musical instruments into the air and play them. They were frequently revealed to 
be untied and operating the instruments themselves and Maskelyne was one of their 
unmaskers - an event that led him into magic<A href="../../references/Christopher1962Panorama.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
</P>
<P>
Maskelyne's design was (with some notoriety<A href="../../references/Genii2003Kellar.html" target=bottom>*</A>) copied by 
Harry Kellar (<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kellar" target=_new>Biography</A>) 
for his "Levitation of Princess Karnac(k)" illusion, which innovated the design for easy travel<A href="../../references/Genii2003Kellar.html" target=bottom>*</A>.  
However, there is some confusion over the matter. For example, 
Kellar was said to have got the design by employing Paul Valadon, Maskelyne's co-worker, c.1905<A href="../../references/Genii2003Kellar.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
While a <A href="http://www.magicgallery.com/images/kelllev1.jpg" target=_new>poster</A> 
of Kellar's from 1905 does advertise a levitating uncovered woman, this is also 
advertised on two posters from 1894 
(<A href="http://www.magicgallery.com/Kellar%20Levitation%201894%20-%20MagicGallery.com.htm" target=_new>one</A>;
<A href="http://memory.loc.gov/service/pnp/cph/3g10000/3g12000/3g12700/3g12756v.jpg" target=_new>two</A>) 
and one from <A href="http://memory.loc.gov/pnp/var/1800/1896/1896r.jpg" target=_new>1900</A>. 
It is possible Kellar may have already featured a simpler wire levitation, 
as possibly shown on this 1876 <A href="http://www.magicgallery.com/Kellar%20Lev%201876.htm#1849%20-%201922" target=_new>poster</A> which features him floating across the audience, and/or an assistant 
suspension on a support. It should be noted that Kellar acted as a bill-poster, assistant and 
manager for the Davenport brothers<A href="../../references/Christopher1962Panorama.html" target=bottom>*</A> (For other contemporary floatings, see also 
this "Bimbo of Bombay" <A href="http://memory.loc.gov/pnp/var/0800/0834/0834r.jpg" target=_new>poster</A> from 1897, 
and Zig Zag <A href="http://memory.loc.gov/pnp/var/1600/1679/1679r.jpg" target=_new>poster</A> of 1899).

The main importance of this for the hoop-pass is that the first extant written description of a hoop-pass seems 
to be in a 
<A href="http://www.magikraft.com/curiosities/acts_data/carter.html" target=_new>review</A> of an act by 
Charles Joseph Carter at the Palace Theatre in 
Manchester in 1910. Carter's levitation was apparently a version of Kellar's, with 
an added engine<A href="../../references/Genii2003Kellar.html" target=bottom>*</A><A href="../../references/Fajuri1999Review.html" target=bottom>*</A>, though a 1905 <A href="http://www.magicgallery.com/Carter%201905%20images.htm" target=_new>poster</A> shows him performing a levitation with props more reminiscent of the LeRoy levitation (see below). 
Carter's use of the hoop may suggest Kellar, and, in turn, Maskelyne, used a hoop-pass, and this would 
go some way to explaining the obvious complexity of the machinery. However, the 
hoop-pass doesn't feature in Kellar's posters, or those 
(<A href="http://www.magicgallery.com/Thur%203%20stro%20lev.htm" target=_new>1908</A>;  
<A href="http://www.magicgallery.com/Thur%20lev%20moore.htm#1869%20-%201936" target=_new>1909</A>)
of his 
chosen "successor" Howard Thurston, though he had apparently added it by 
<A href="http://www.magicgallery.com/Thurston%20images%202.htm#She%20Floats" target=_new>1929</A>.

In a separate development, Servais LeRoy took the levitation of an assistant and, in 1902, added the 
twist of covering their body prior to floating, only to whip the cloth off mid- or post-flight to 
reveal they had vanished (the <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asrah_levitation" target=_new>ASRAH</A> Levitation : 
<A href="http://experts.about.com/e/a/as/asrah_levitation.htm" target=_new>Mechanism</A>; see also his 
"Rostrum" Levitation: 
1920 <A href="http://www.magicgallery.com/images/ltbrostrum.jpg" target=_new>poster</a>). 


A 1907 
<A href="http://www.magicgallery.com/images/ltblev.jpg" target=_new>poster</A> for LeRoy's act shows 
an uncovered woman levitating over a brazier and a hoop prop. That the hoop was used for a 
hoop-pass seems likely, and this is confirmed a 1915 
Harry Rouclere <A href="http://www.magicgallery.com/images/roucazra.jpg" target=_new>poster</A> advertising the three stages of the 
ASRAH (here "AZRA").

By 1910 it appears the hoop-pass was a confirmed element in magician's advertising: 
stock posters for ASHRA-style levitations by French Lithographer 
Galice (<A href="http://www.magicgallery.com/images/stock%20french%20lev.jpg" target=_new>poster</A>, 1910) 
and German Lithographer 
Friedlander (<A href="http://www.magicgallery.com/images/stock%20french%20lev.jpg" target=_new>poster</A>, 1913)
both feature the Hoop-Pass. 

Other adverts featuring the Hoop-Pass include a 
<A href="http://www.magicgallery.com/Mel-Roy%203%20sht%20lev.htm" target=_new>poster</A> for 
Mel-Roy (c.1932); an advert for the "Great [Eugene] Laurant Company" 
and their "Phantom Bride" levitation (1915 or earlier), which shows a large hoop ready for use 
(not online, but can be found in 
Christopher<A href="../../references/Christopher1962Panorama.html" target=bottom>*</A>); and
a Richards <A href="http://memory.loc.gov/service/pnp/cph/3g00000/3g08000/3g08200/3g08225v.jpg" target=_new>bill</A> of 1911.

The modern master constructor of hoops for hoop-passes
