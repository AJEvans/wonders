Hughes (<A href="../../references/Hughes1999Prehistoric.html" target=bottom>*</A>p.19;32;66)  
actually suggests there are a total of 60 cairns around the stone on Cefn Bryn, some, or most of which, 
may be mounds created by agricultural clearance. Of those worth mention, she notes two lesser ring cairns  
(300m southeast of stone: a ring; 150m northeast: a low mound within a ring ditch); the "Great Cairn" 
(obvious cairn just west of stone); and two ring cairns on the north of the ridge, the larger of which (200m northwest)
has an entrance gap in the main ring and an inner ring of kerbstones, with the entrance and the space between the 
two rings having been filled in at some later point, the latter with quartz. The smaller (just northwest of the stone) 
had two entrances, one of which was blocked. In neither of the latter two cases 
has any trace of burial been found, though fires appear to have been lit inside both, with some burnt 
bone placed in the latter. Indeed, no burial has been found associated with the stone 
itself<A href="../../references/Hughes1999Prehistoric.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
