It should be noted that much of what follows is culled from various 
Magician's discussion boards online, though I am slowly checking 
printed sources. Magician's are notoriously keen to distract people from 
the real manner in which illusions are performed.

For good introductions to the history of magic see the 1911 Encyclopedia 
Britannica article on 
<A href="http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Conjuring" target=_new>Conjuring</A> 
and, for a different slant, the Catholic Encyclopedia article on 
<A href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11197b.htm" target=_new>Occultism</A>. 
A developing site with promise can also be found 
<A href="http://www.magicandillusion.com/libr/libr01.html" target=_new>here</A>.

The most complete work on floating objects is probably 
Armstrong's (1976; 1983)
