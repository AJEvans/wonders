The rock infront of the body could be a metaphor of this kind. For example, in the 
life of St&nbsp;Teilo<A href="../../references/Rees1840Liber.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/teilo.html" target=_new>Translation</A>) he is described as 
moving through life as if he had a candle (i.e. religious truth) preceding him, and one could see a rock in the same fashion, however, the 
story clearly regards the rock as a concrete object.
