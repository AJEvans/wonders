For example, rating the founding saints of various 11-13th C. institutions as superior over  
others for the purpose of gaining precedence, and therefore power. The classic example of 
this is the development of the "Book of Llandaff/Llan D&#226;v" (See 
<A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>) which 
contains many details of the saints. This largely reworks older works, including land 
grants, to the benefit of the Church of Llan D&#226;v. One result of this movement was the 
repetition of events ascribed to more than one saint, as an impressive feat had to 
be replicated for the glory of god and, more importantly, the saint.
