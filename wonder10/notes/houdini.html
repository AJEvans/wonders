Houdini made the claim that this trick was older in <I>The Unmasking of Robert Houdin</I><A href="../../references/Weiss1908Houdin.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(1908: <A href="http://www.qualitymagicbooks.com/?nd=toc&key=2185" target=_new>Summary</A> of some of the arguments). 
You can read more details of previous tricks of this nature 
<A href="http://www.cometamagico.com.ar/houdin2.htm" target=_new>here</A><A href="../../references/White2001Houdin.html" target=bottom>*</A>. While 
the Time Magazine photographs don't seem to be in the Time archive, you 
can read an apparent copy of the 1833 People's Magazine 
article<A href="../../references/Peoples1833Air.html" target=bottom>*</A>, with an 
illustration of a Fakir doing the trick 
<A href="http://www.illusionata.com/mpt/view.php?id=24&type=articles" target=_new>here</A>. 
A Thurston <A href="http://www.magicgallery.com/Thurston%20images%201.htm#East%20Indian%20rope%20trick" target=_new>poster</A> 
featured the trick in 1927.
 You can also see a 
modern example of the trick <A href="http://www.di-design.nl/index_bestanden/Page1770.htm" target=_new>here</A>. 
The degree to which this is any 
more "ancient" than 1833 is not determinable.
