<P>
In terms of the likely identity of our body, a number of saints have floating stones associated with their burial. 
</P>
<P>
A strong contender must be Samson of Dol - in the Life of Illtud<A href="../references/WadeEvans1944Vitae.html" target=bottom>*</A> his body 
is placed in a sarcophagus, which floats back to his Master Illtud's harbour 
for burial<SUP><A href="notes/samson.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>. Equally St&nbsp;Gildas 
requested that his body be left to float on the sea in a boat with the stone on which he used to sleep 
(his 11th C. Life by the Monk of 
Ruys [<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/gildas07.html" target=_new>Translation</A>]<A href="../references/Williams1899Lives.html" target=bottom>*</A> then goes on to detail 
the boat sinking and the body being split between various locations, doubtless to explain the disparate relics scattered 
around his churches). 
In addition, 
St&nbsp;Teilo<A href="../references/Rees1840Liber.html" target=bottom>*</A> (<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/teilo.html" target=_new>Translation</A> of 12th C. Life) 
took a stone coffin so large only ten oxen could pull it, and floated it in front of his ship in order to pick 
up a king, Gerennius, who was waiting to die.

Finally, another strong contender is St&nbsp;Carannog 
(<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/carannog1.html" target=_new>Translation</A> of 12th C. Life<A href="../references/Rees1853Lives.html" target=bottom>*</A>), the father of all altar-floaters. 
He was given an altar, the colour of which was unfathomable, while 
living in a cave. This altar, floating, preceded him when he sailed across the Severn and he frequently 
cast it upon the sea to follow the path it dictated, occasionally loosing it with various consequences (at one point it ended up 
as a table in Arthur's court, that would throw off all objects placed on it).
</P>
<P>
However, with the exception of Gildas, none of the saints specifically requested their 
remains be lost, and with the exception of Samson, none asked to be returned to Illtud - though 
Gildas was also Illtud's student<SUP><A href="notes/coed.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>.
</P> 
<P>
A final question is why the man <I>wanted</I> to be lost: it seems like people used saints' graves 
to swear oaths on, and this person wasn't keen on the practice. A lot of the saints were 
a) fighting Pagan stone-worshippers (at least according to the later Lives)
b) miserable so-and-sos, so it isn't entirely surprising<SUP><A href="notes/swearing.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP>.
