"There is another wonder in Guyr - the altar, which is in the place, which is called Loyngarth, which is held up by the will of god. It seems better to me to narrate the history of that altar than to keep silent. But the fact is, while Saint Iltut was worshiping in the cave, which is next to the sea, which laps against the ground at the said place,
(the mouth of the cave, also, is on the sea), and, behold, a ship was sailing towards him and two 
men sailing her and the corpse of a holy man was with them in the boat and the altar over the face of it,
which was held up by the will of god and the man of god [Iltut] has advanced in their way 
and the corpse of the holy man and the altar remained inseparably above/before the face of the holy 
body. And they have said to saint Iltut: "that man of god has entrusted to us, 
in order that we might draw that person to you and we might 
bury him with you, and the name of him you may not reveal to any person, that men may not swear by him."

Those two men returned to the ship and they have sailed. But that saint Iltut has established  
a church around/near the corpse of the holy man and around/near the altar and it continues  
all the time to this present day the altar is held up by the will of god.

A certain minor king has come, in order that he might test, carrying a twig in his hand;  
he has formed a curve around the altar and he has held the twig by both hands from both sides 
and he has drawn it to himself in such a way the truth of that thing he has proved and that person afterwards 
during the month uninjured/untouched died.
Another in truth [?for the truth] under the altar has looked and the sight of the eyes he has lost and 
before the month uninjured/untouched his life he has ended."<SUP><A href="notes/translation.html" target=bottom>1</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/alternatives.html" target=bottom>2</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/silence.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP>

This is the Wonder with something for everyone: magic, intrigue, death and - rarely for this wonder list, given its 
potential author was a monk - religion. Altars that floated on the sea were a stock element of celtic 
saint's lives in the Dark Ages and beyond, but this has the added mystery of a secret corpse 
(See <A href="myth.html">Myth</A>) 
and what must surely be 
the first description of what is known as the "hoop pass" in magic circles. 

Loyngarth in Guyr has been identified as Llwyngarth on the Gower,
now Ystum-llwynarth or <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=261000&Y=189000&width=500&height=300&gride=265313.591961775&gridn=193226.510765736&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=25000&down.x=259&down.y=325" target=_new class=place>Oystermouth</A><SUP><A href="notes/llwyngarth.html" target=bottom>4</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/coed.html" target=bottom>5</A></SUP>. The saint in question is Saint Illtud. While neither the cave nor church have been identified, strong contenders include "Bob's Cave" on <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=262000.812350706&Y=187000.624074761&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=&zm=0&scale=25000&right.x=512&right.y=166" target=_new class=place>Mumbles&nbsp;Head</A><SUP><A href="notes/caves.html" target=bottom>6</A></SUP> and a chapel which 
may have been on <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=260000.812350706&Y=188000.624074761&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=&zm=0&scale=25000&right.x=511&right.y=164" target=_new class=place>Knab Rock</A> or nearby (now destroyed)<SUP><A href="notes/chapel.html" target=bottom>7</A></SUP>. Despite this the wonder is commonly 
regarded as referring to the dolmen 
"<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=249500&Y=190000&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=&zm=1&scale=25000" target=_new class=place>Arthur's Stone</A>" or 
<I>Maen Cetti</I>, some seven miles distant<SUP><A href="notes/cetti.html" target=bottom>8</A></SUP>. It seems much more likely 
it refers to a now-destroyed rock-arch which once stood by Knab Rock<SUP><A href="notes/arch.html" target=bottom>9</A></SUP>.
