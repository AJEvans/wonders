There is some confusion here, undoubtably because of the subserviency associated with 
saints studying under other saints, and their position as political tools 
(See <A href="../notes/saints.html" target=bottom>Note</A>). 
The 13th C. Life of St&nbsp;Dubricius<A href="../../references/Rees1840Liber.html" target=bottom>*</A>  
(<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/dubricius.html" target=_new>Translation</A>)
has Samson as Illtud's disciple. In addition, 

the 11th C. (or earlier) Ruys Life of St&nbsp;Gildas<A href="../../references/Williams1899Lives.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/gildas07.html" target=_new>Translation</A>) 
identifies the teacher of Samson and Paul, as well as the young Gildas, as Hildutus, the head of a great school. 
However, the Life identifies the school as 
being on a narrow island, and as Gildas was originally from what is now the Scottish borders, it is not at all 
clear from the Life that Hildutus' school was in Wales. Despite the slight variation on the name, Hildutus' 
island is, according to the Life, still known as Llanilltud.

Despite these two sources, the 15th C. Titus D.XXII Life of St&nbsp;David<A href="../../references/Rees1853Lives.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(<A href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC15336363&id=yT5-_9BXoaoC&pg=PA426&dq=Beuno&as_brr=1#PRA7-PA404,M1" target=_new>Translation</A>), for example, 
has David as taught by Paulinus, while the 11th C. Life by Rhygyfarch ["Ricemarsh"]<A href="../../references/Rees1853Lives.html" target=bottom>*</A>  
(<A href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC15336363&id=yT5-_9BXoaoC&pg=PA426&dq=Beuno&as_brr=1#PRA7-PA426,M1" target=_new>Translation</A>) 
has David setting up his own School in "Glyn Rosyn, then called Hodnant". His disciples 
included Eliud.
Eliud is identified in both this Life and his 13th C. Life <A href="../../references/Rees1840Liber.html" target=bottom>*</A>  
(<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/teilo.html" target=_new>Translation</A>) as St&nbsp;Teilo. However, one might note that 
in the (possibly very early) Life of St&nbsp;Samson<A href="../../references/Taylor1925Vita.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(<A href="http://www.lamp.ac.uk/celtic/Samson.htm" target=_new>Translation</A>), his master is noted 
as Eltut, and Illtud's life itself is largely a magpie collection of traditional themes. This said, the name 
Iltud is testified from the "Illtud Stone" at 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-3.48340&GridN=51.40900&lon=-3.48340&lat=51.40900&search_result=Llantwit%20Major%2C%20Vale%20of%20Glamorgan&db=freegaz&place=Llantwit%20Major%2C%20Vale%20of%20Glamorgan&pc=&client=public&addr2=&quicksearch=Llantwit%20Major&addr3=&scale=100000&addr1=" target=_new class=place>Llantwit&nbsp;Major</A>

<P>
One thing all the Lives that mention Illtud are clear on, and that is his high level of education and his 
excellence as a teacher. The Life of St&nbsp;Samson<A href="../../references/Taylor1925Vita.html" target=bottom>*</A> has him as <Q>of all the Britons the most accomplished in the Scriptures, namely of the Old and New Testaments, and in philosophy of every kind, of form, geometry namely, and of rhetoric, grammar and arithmetic, and of all the theories of philosophy. And by birth he was a most wise magician, having knowledge of the future</Q>. The life also notes that he himself was a student of St&nbsp;Germanus.
