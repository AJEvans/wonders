<P>
The petrification of thieves is another common theme in the Lives of the "Celtic Saints". 
In some cases this is literal, as with Illtud: in the Life of Deiniol<A href="../../references/BaringGouldFischer1913Lives.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/deiniol.html" target=_new>translation</A>), he changes two oxen theives into stones. However, the thieves are often just rendered unable to move, for example in the Ruys Life<A href="../../references/Williams1899Lives.html" target=bottom>*</A> (<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/gildas07.html" target=_new>Translation</A>), 
St&nbsp;Gildas causes thieves about to rob him to 
stick to the ground, stiff as stones, while in the Jocelin Life<A href="../../references/OLeary1880Lives.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(<A href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/8/4/8/18482/18482-h/18482-h.htm" target=_new>Translation</A>) St&nbsp;Patrick renders the arms of two fighting brothers as stiff as stone or wood.

More complex is the tale of thieves bettered in the Life of Kentigern<A href="../../references/Green1998Kentigern.html" target=bottom>*</A>   
(<A href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/Jocelyn-LifeofKentigern.html" target=_new>Translation</A>). 
In this story, thieves try to steal one of the saints rams, and cut off its head to stop it moving. Miraculously the headless ram runs 
back to its flock before falling down, while its head turns to stone and sticks to the thieves hands. At this the men 
freeze with confusion, like the stone they are carrying, finally going to the saint to beg forgiveness.
The saint accepts their apologies, gives them the ram, but keeps the head, which, even though mute, prophesied the 
qualities of the saint. Similarly, in the Life of St&nbsp;Tydecho, King Maelgwn steals the saint's oxen, but, having failed to 
stop the saint ploughing, sets his dogs on him, sitting on a rock to watch. When he tries to get up, he finds 
himself stuck to the rock<A href="../../references/Henken1987Traditions.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(possibly the rock <I>Gwely Tydecho</I> "Tydecho's Bed"<A href="../../references/Henken1987Traditions.html" target=bottom>*</A>, near

The saint only releases him after he turns over his lands to him<A href="../../references/Henken1987Traditions.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
