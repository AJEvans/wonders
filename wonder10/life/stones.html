Samson is buried between a rectangle of upright stones within a cemetery, with a stone cross above and the sign of a bishop below. Plausibly
this might refer to an older dolmen. 

There certainly is some ambiguity in the use of stones within christian ritual. 
In the <I>Leabhar Breac</I> Life of St&nbsp;Patrick<A href="../../references/Stokes1877Betha.html" target=bottom>*</A>  
(<A href="http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T201009/index.html" target=_new>Translation</A>) Patrick fasts with four stones around him, 
and another under him, for forty days and nights. In the Tripartite Life<A href="../../references/OLeary1880Lives.html" target=bottom>*</A>, his seat is said to be between three stones on which are the names  
Jesus, Soter, and Salvator (<A href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/8/4/8/18482/18482-h/18482-h.htm" target=_new>Translation</A>), and 
in the Jocelyn Life<A href="../../references/OLeary1880Lives.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(<A href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/8/4/8/18482/18482-h/18482-h.htm" target=_new>Translation</A>) 
four stones are erected in a churchyard to celebrate Patrick, two followers, and a boy they resurrected. 

The view in the Lives 
generally that Pagans worshiped stones must render these descriptions somewhat ambiguous.

However, despite this theme, the conditions of the burial of Samson may be better revealed by the 
discovery of a stone at 

<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-3.48340&GridN=51.40900&lon=-3.48340&lat=51.40900&search_result=Llantwit%20Major%2C%20Vale%20of%20Glamorgan&db=freegaz&place=Llantwit%20Major%2C%20Vale%20of%20Glamorgan&pc=&client=public&addr2=&quicksearch=Llantwit%20Major&addr3=&scale=100000&addr1=" target=_new class=place>Llantwit&nbsp;Major</A> 

which purports to have been raised by Samson, with Illtud's name also on it (the "Illtud Stone": 
<A href="http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=15023" target=_new>Overview and photos</A>). 

This stone had a cist burial directly under it<A href="../../references/CISP2000LTWIT2.html" target=bottom>*</A>, replicating the description extremely 
well.
