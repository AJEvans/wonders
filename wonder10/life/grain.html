The theme of storehouses lifted by a saint and floated to another place also occurs in the 
Life of St&nbsp;Kentigern<A href="../../references/Green1998Kentigern.html" target=bottom>*</A> (<A href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/Jocelyn-LifeofKentigern.html" target=_new>Translation</A>). 
In this tale, Morken, king of the area around the Clyde, refuses the saint food for his monks and suggests that their god will 
feed them, which he does by flooding the Clyde and carrying the king's storehouses to them.
