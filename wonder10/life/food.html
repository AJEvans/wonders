The story of the food is very similar to that involving King Maelgwn in the Life of 
Brynach<A href="../../references/WadeEvans1944Vitae.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/brynach.html" target=_new>Translation</A>). In this tale Maelgwn first demands food, and is 
later freely offered it. However, Brynach has no suitable food, so he plucks loaves from an oak tree standing nearby (which the Life 
says is still called the 'Bread Oak'), and draws wine from the River Caman, as well as stones which become fish. In the 
Life of St&nbsp;Kieran<A href="../../references/OGrady1892Silva.html" target=bottom>*</A> 
(<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/kieran.html" target=_new>Translation</A>), Kieran blesses "flesh", and changes it into oil, fish, pottage and various meats, while in the Life of St&nbsp;Molasius<A href="../../references/OGrady1892Silva.html" target=bottom>*</A> (<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/molasius.html" target=_new>Translation</A>) we find that Molasius feeds staving orphans by breaking up black and decayed pots and turning the fragments into portions of meat, as well as clothing.
