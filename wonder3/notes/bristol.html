Although it is widely believed that Bath has the only 
geothermally heated surface spring in Britain, this is not  
true. For example, the spring at

It could be found on the intertidal mud next to an Iron Age 
causeway throughout the Iron Age, Roman, and Saxon use of the area<A href="../../references/Pascoe2001History.html">*</A>. The 
causeway is now destroyed, but was at the location currently beneath the Clifton Suspension 
Bridge. The spring, which can still be visited, was pumped for a Spa
