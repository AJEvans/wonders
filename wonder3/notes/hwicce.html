You can find out more about the Hwicce 
<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwicce" target=_new>here</A>, 
and their part in the history of Bath 
<A href="http://www.buildinghistory.org/bath/saxon/dobunni.htm" target=_new>here</A><A href="../../references/Manco1998Bath.html">*</A>.

Of course, our interest in them only extends as far as we can rely on 
the translations of the Latin 
variations (See Note on <A href="alternatives.html">Alternatives</A>) to "Hwicce", but it seems generally accepted.

The use of the term to describe the area around Bath might give us a limit on 
when the list of wonders was composed - suggesting it is after 
the capture of Bath by the Saxons, listed in the Anglo-Saxon 
Chronicles (see <A href="" target=right>Other Works</A>) as happening in 577&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../../references/Manco1998Bath.html">*</A>, and probably 
after 628&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../../references/Manco1998Bath.html">*</A>.
