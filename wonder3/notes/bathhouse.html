Though this isn't explicit in what has been said, it is 
unlikely a standard Roman bathhouse, of which there would have  
been plenty in post-Roman Britain, would have caught the eye of 
our compiler. Impressive Roman bath complexes, like 
those at Chedworth (which may have had an impressive, late, Romano-British 
religious function<A href="../../references/Adams2003Chedworth.html">*</A>) or Wroxeter<A href="../../references/AnonHeritageWroxeter.html">*</A> 
(which is closer to Droitwich, possible site of the 
<A href="../../wonder4/index.html" target=right>The Fourth Wonder</A>: see also Reno<A href="../../references/Reno1996Badon.html">*</A>) would have been ruined by the end of the 4th/5th C., and 
therefore cold by the time of the Hwicce. It is likely that only a 
geothermal pool would have been both warm and wonderful - at least 
one was picked out by a Saxon poet as a <I>Wundrum</I> (Wonder) 
(See Note on "<A href="ruin.html">The&nbsp;Ruin</A>").
