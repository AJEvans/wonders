The evidence for <I>Sul</I> (which may be short for, or latinized into, the Roman <I>Sulis</I>) is 
the Roman name for Bath <I>"Aquae Sulis"</I>, and a variety of 
objects dedicated to Sulis-Minerva, which can now be found in 
the <A href="http://www.romanbaths.co.uk/index.cfm?UUID=59F8EE80-E027-41DB-9459AC9A8DE1F8D9" target=_new>collections</A> at the Bath house museum at Bath. The assumption is that Sulis was a local deity 
that was combined with Minerva by the Romans.

There is actually a spring known as <I>Ffynnon Sul</I> behind <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-4.30600&GridN=51.73780&lon=-4.30600&lat=51.73780&db=freegaz&cidr_client=none&lang=&place=Kidwelly,Carmarthenshire&pc=&advanced=&client=public&addr2=&quicksearch=Kidwelly&addr3=&scale=100000&addr1=" target=_new class=place>Kidwelly</A> Castle<A href="../../references/Jones1954Wells.html">*</A>, near Swansea. 
The oldest recorded name for it is <I>Funnon Syell</I> (1597 C.E.: pronounced <I>Su-ilth</I>?) 
though it is very far from clear that there is any relationship - firstly as there is  
~1500 years between the <I>Sul</I> of Bath and <I>Syell</I> of Kilwelly 
in which the spring may or may not have had a history, and secondly because subsequent names 
pick up on <I>Sul</I> being "Sunday" in Welsh and label it "(St.)Sunday's Well" 
(1624; 1678 C.E.)<A href="../../references/Jones1954Wells.html">*</A>. In actual fact, it is much more likely 
to be from St.Tysilio, who's name was often shortened to "Sulien" 
(particularly in Brittany<A href="../../references/Henken1987Traditions.html" target=bottom>*</A>; <I>to</I>/<I>ty</I> being an honorific 
prefix<A href="../../references/Henken1987Traditions.html" target=bottom>*</A>), though, rather unusually for a 'celtic' saint, extant material on him doesn't 
mention any springs popping up around him<A href="../../references/Henken1987Traditions.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
