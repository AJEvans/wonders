In addition to the Hwicce link, the description of a pool 
surrounded by a wall matches well with the formation of 
Bath's baths around a central walled pool<A href="../../references/AnonRomanbathsSite.html">*</A>. In addition, 
the (8th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN>?<A href="../../references/AnonDilettanteRuin.html">*</A>) Saxon poem <A href="http://www.haplessdilettante.com/toc2.html?ruin.html~top.body" target=_new>The Ruin</A> from the 
10th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN> <A href="http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&UID=5241" target=_new>Exeter Book</A>, which is likely to 
be set in Bath because of its mention of natural hot springs 
and massive ruins, matches the same description well:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Mood quickened mind, and a man of wit, /
cunning in rings, bound bravely the wallbase /
with iron, a wonder... /
wide streams welled /
hot from source, and a wall all caught / 
in its bright bosom, that the baths were /
hot at hall's hearth, that was fitting... / 
Thence hot streams loosed, ran over hoar stone,... / 
into the ring tank.<A href="../../references/AnonDilettanteRuin.html">*</A>
