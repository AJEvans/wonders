The attribution of the pool to Bath has caused endless debate. 
The is chiefly because manuscript 
<A href="../../history/manuscripts.html#L" target=right>L</A> has 
attached a 13th C. table of contents (though the 
detail may be older)  
which includes in a summary of this Wonder the 
additional information <I>"in quo balnea sunt Badonis"</I>
("where the baths of Badon are") (confusingly, in the translation left by Morris after his death<A href="../../references/Morris1980Nennius.html">*</A>, this is added to the body of the text, though explicitly denoted as being from the table of contents by being 
in italics). Unfortunately, "Badon" is the site of a major 
battle which Nennius ascribes to Arthur, and the equation "Badon = Bath" has geopolitical ramifications for those who want to claim Arthur was born and lived in their part of Britain. It's better 
to ignore this and look at where the most likely hot pools are  
when deciding this Wonder's location (which is the tack taken here), 
but if you want know more you can find online 
summaries of the various 
debates from various viewpoints  
by McDougall<A href="../../references/McDougallManco2000Badon.html">*</A> and
