"Wonder three - the hot pool, which is in the region of the Huich and encircled by a wall made 
of brick and stone and to that place men go during all seasons to be washed and to each, 
as it may have pleased them, the bath thus may be made according to his own will: 
if he may have willed, the bath will be cold, if warm, it will be warm."<SUP><A href="notes/translation.html" target=bottom>1</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/alternatives.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>

This wonder is likely to be a geological one - a geothermally heated 
pool<SUP><A href="notes/bathhouse.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP>. The Hwicce were Saxons who's territory included the town of Bath<SUP><A href="notes/hwicce.html" target=bottom>4</A></SUP>, so it seems likely that the pool in question are the geothermal baths there<SUP><A href="notes/ruin.html" target=bottom>5</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/bath.html" target=bottom>6</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/bristol.html" target=bottom>7</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/springs.html" target=bottom>8</A></SUP>.

The use of the hot springs at Bath predates the 
Romans, who combined the local British deity worshiped 
there <I>Sul</I><SUP><A href="notes/sul.html" target=bottom>9</A></SUP> with their own <I>Minerva</I>. The Temple and 
Bath Complex dedicated to this double Goddess continued, probably to 
the 4th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN> when Pagan temples were closed down by the Emperor Theodosius<A href="../references/AnonRomanbathsSite.html" target=bottom>*</A>. The fact that temple pediment stones were 
reused as paving within the complex<A href="../references/AnonRomanbathsSite.html" target=bottom>*</A> seems to suggest the 
area continued to be used<SUP><A href="notes/dating.html" target=bottom>5</A></SUP>, and evidence that hot water 
still flowed in a walled pool here during Saxon times 
(when our list was compiled) can be found in the Saxon poem 
about Bath "<A href="http://www.haplessdilettante.com/toc2.html?ruin.html~top.body" target=_new>The Ruin</A>"<SUP><A href="notes/ruin.html" target=bottom>6</A></SUP>.

Mood quickened mind, and a man of wit,
cunning in rings, bound bravely the wallbase
with iron, a wonder.
