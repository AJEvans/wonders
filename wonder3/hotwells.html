The spring at <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=357500.524166046&Y=172500.956867082&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=50000&multimap.x=175&multimap.y=104" target=_new class=place>Hotwells</A>, Clifton, Bristol, could be found on the 
intertidal mud next to an Iron Age causeway throughout the Iron Age, Roman, and Saxon use of the 
area<A href="../references/Pascoe2001History.html" target=bottom>*</A>. The causeway is now destroyed, 
but was at the location currently beneath the Clifton Suspension Bridge.

What is probably the spring itself 
can still be seen on the Bristol side of the banks a couple of hundred 
metres downstream from the bridge, where it issues into an unusually algae-covered 
channel through the mud, and runs down to the Bristol Avon 
(<A href="photos/hotwells-spring.html" class=photo>Photo</A>). Despite the crumpled ironwork around the spring, which 
may or may not be associated with it, no one in their right minds would cross the 
mud to try and reach it, so it is hardly surprising to find that if you are willing 
to take what must be almost as great a risk and cross the road, you can see 
what is possibly an old spring housing directly inland of it (<A href="photos/hotwells-housing.html" class=photo>Photo</A>) 
(<A href="photos/hotwells-bars.html" class=photo>Photo</A>).

The spring was pumped for a Spa and gave water at 23<SUP>o</SUP>C./74<SUP>o</SUP>F.<A href="../references/PeenOldtownsBristol.html" target=bottom>*</A>, and a walk 
directly above, along the top of the cliff, will bring you to the remains of the old 
Spa pumproom (<A href="photos/hotwells-pumproom.html" class=photo>Photo</A>) inscribed 
<Q>This spring was - The original pump room erected 1694 - renowned</Q>, and 
afford you a glorious view across the length of the bridge (<A href="photos/hotwells-bridge.html" class=photo>Photo</A>) (<A href="http://www.clifton-suspension-bridge.org.uk/" target=_new>info on the bridge</A>).
