Who decided to up the wonder 
quota by suggesting the lake had a remarkable coincident of 60 islands, lakes and 
streams is unclear. It is certainly true that, even today, there is some 
debate about the number of islands in Loch Lomond, though it is unlikely 
it reaches 60. You can read about the islands

In addition to the geographical wonder, however, the lake has 
a mythological nature as well. Eagles were often prophetic birds 
in the Dark Ages<SUP><A href="notes/eagles.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>, 
and the eagles of this lake were meant to 
come together when trouble hit Britain<SUP><A href="notes/trouble.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>.

In addition King Arthur is said to have starved to death Scots and Pictish warriors 
who sought refugue from him on the islands as he tried to clear Britain of 
barbarians<SUP><A href="notes/barbarians.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP>. It is hard to doubt that 
one of the reasons the lake caught the eye of people in the Dark Age was its defensive 
qualities. Lake edge dwellings on artificial islands known as "Crannogs<SUP><A href="notes/crannogs.html" target=bottom>4</A></SUP>" were in favour in Scotland from 
5000 years ago to almost the present day, in part for their strong defensive 
capabilities.
