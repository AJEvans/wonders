See, for example, the <I>Proffwydolyaeth yr Eryr</I> 
("Prophecy of the Eagle" : 
<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/eryr.html" target=_new>Welsh</A>)
from the <I>Llyfr Gwyn Rhydderch</I> (The White Book of Rhydderch: see 
<A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>) 
and the Welsh poem 
<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/eagle.html" target=_new>The Dialogue of Arthur and Eliwlod</A>. Geoffrey of Monmouth refused 
in the <I>Historia Regum Brittaniae</I> [ii.9]
(see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>) to translate the prophecies of an eagle given during the building of Shaftesbury.   
Geoffrey implies [xii.18] that the "Auguries of the Eagle" he refuses to translate was 
one of the great books of British prophecy used in the 'Dark Age'. 
Such a book may or may not have included the <I>Proffwydolyaeth yr Eryr</I>, 
as prophecies tended to be somewhat fluid. For example,  
Crick<A href="../../references/Crick1999Geoffrey.html">*</A> notes that the Auguries may be those attributed to "Merlin Sylvester" by Gerald of Wales in his <I>Expugnatio hibernica</I> ("Conquest of Ireland" : 1187-8 C.E.).
