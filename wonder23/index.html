<P>
Inland water bodies that act with the tide are consistently regarded as wonders across the 
ages<SUP><A href="notes/early.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP>. The most common features involved are wells and springs (see, for example, 
<A href="../wonder6/index.html" target=right>Wonder&nbsp;6</A>) &#150; all the more remarkable when the water issuing from them is fresh<SUP><A href="notes/tidal.html" target=bottom>4</A></SUP> (though 
we have no indication that this is the case here). While most translations of this wonder go with "ford", it seems unlikely &#150; why, for example, does it not mention the associated stream instead? "Shallows" seems more reasonable. As it is, there are no obvious records of tidal springs or wells or fords on Anglesey, though there are areas of coastal geology that would be appropriate. The nearest feature to the wonder-description is the lagoon
