...at Mall-traeth marsh, about the <A href="http://www.multimap.com/maps/?q=Malltraeth&countryCode=GB#map=53.21031,-4.32535|14|4&dp=904&bd=useful_information&loc=GB:53.21678:-4.33016:14|Malltraeth|" target=_new class=place>middle place between
tha sea and the farthest inland points</A> of it, and very near the land, they
find, by digging for coals, a perfect sea-shore with all its symptoms, as
pebbles, shells, &c. under five or six yards of pure sand, as I have been
credibly informed by an intelligent person concerned in those coal-
works; and yet the surface there is very little above the level of the sea,
as: appears by its frequent flowing up to that place; and if the channel
was originally so deep there, so near the shore of it, any one may pro-
portionably conjecture, not only how deep the whole bay was, but also
how far the sea flowed up to the adjacent rising grounds towards Keint
and Kefenny ; two brooks discharging themselves into that marsh.
