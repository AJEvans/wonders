"Wonder four is the stone that walks at night-time above the valley of Citheinn, 
also formerly it is thrown down the watery hollow Cereuus, which is in the middle of the sea which is 
called Mene,  and on the morrow above the bank on  top of said valley is is discovered without doubt."<SUP><A href="notes/translation.html" target=bottom>1</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/alternatives.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>

This wonder has been identified by Walter Gill<A href="../references/Gill1939Man.html" target=bottom>*</A> as the 
<I>Maen&nbsp;Morddwyd</i> ["The Thigh Stone"], apparently 
built into the wall of the ruined church of 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/maps/?q=Porthamel+&countryCode=GB#map=53.1779,-4.25168|15|4&dp=904&bd=useful_information&loc=GB:53.17762:-4.25357:15|Llanedwen|" class=place target=_new>St.Nidan's</A><SUP><A href="notes/aidans.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP> next 
to Llanidan House in south-western Anglesey.  


The connection relies on a description by Gerald of Wales in his 
"Journey through Wales" of a thigh-bone shaped stone that always returned to its home, even if, as happened in c.1098&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>, it was thrown into the sea. He also reported 
it had a number of somewhat more dissolute properties (see 
<A href="myth.html" target=right>Myth</A>).

Thomas Pennant, who reported on a visit to the House in the 1770s, 
stated that Gerald's stone was built into the church (<A href="../references/Pennant1778TourIII.html" target=bottom>*</A>p.9). 

In 1833 Lewis<A href="../references/Lewis1849Topographic.html" target=bottom>*</A> reported that the stone was said to have been built into the 
wall but was "<Q>not sufficiently conspicuous to be easily distinguished</Q>". By 1849 the church was at least partly destroyed 
and it isn't entirely clear what happened to the stone<SUP><A href="notes/end.html" target=bottom>4</A></SUP>. The remaining parts of the church are now a private burial chapel<A href="../references/COFLEIN2004Llanidan.html" target=bottom>*</A><A href="../references/COFLEIN2004Llanidan2.html" target=bottom>*</A>

Cereuus is identified in the "Sawley" variants of the <I>Historia</I> 
as Pwll Ceris<SUP><A href="notes/alternatives.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>, also known as the "Swellies"<SUP><A href="notes/ceris.html" target=bottom>5</A></SUP>: an

bridges over the Menai Straits (hense <I>Mene</I>), which is known for 
its chaotic tidal whirlpools. This site was also identified, probably independently, by Llanidan's vicar, Henry Rowlands (<A href="../references/Rowlands1766Mona.html" target=bottom>*</A>p.4).   



The valley of 

Citheinn is unknown, but is probably the major valley of the
