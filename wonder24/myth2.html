It is said also that if the "work of Venus" takes place in the same place or nearby it will happen, as is proved a number of times, at once the stone will sweat great drops. Similarly, in addition, if a man and woman practice acts leading to degradation in that very place [it occurs]. Out of the congress actually finished in that place, at no time has any one going to bear a child born one. From which, and on account of this, the small hut, deserted inside, which was formerly customarily there in that place, only by a fated/deadly wall of rock the stone you may see encircled [ie. only the wall of the hut surrounds the stone with some kind of accursed wall??].

Which may explain why Henry Rowlands<a href="../references/Rowlands1766Mona.html" target="bottom">*</a>, who was both an antiquarian and the local vicar, never mentioned the stone. Given that Gerald was writing in 1187&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN> one is loathed to bring up pagan survival, but given all the above, and that Lewis<A href="../references/Lewis1849Topographic.html" target=bottom>*</A> reported the old church was "erected in an inclosure almost circular, surrounded by 'tall ancestral trees'", 
the dumping of  the rock in whirlpools,  
and that the bones of St&nbsp;Nidan stored at the church may actually be 
those of a woman<A href="../references/Gledhill2000Spin.html" target=bottom>*</A>, one does get the feeling that back then, this wonder had more about it than meets the eye.
