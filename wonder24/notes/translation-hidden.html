Translation for this site. The original was Dimock<A href="../../references/DeBarri1187Itinerarium.html" target=bottom>*</A>:  
<I>Dicitur etiam quod si venereum opus in loco eodem vel prope fieri contigerit, sicut aliquoties probatum est, statim lapis guttis magnis desudabit. Similiter etiam si procacitatem ibidem vir et mulier exercuerint. Ex venere quoque ibidem expleta nunquam genitura provenit. Unde et ob hoc, casula deserta penitus qu&#130; ibidem olim esse solebat, tantum muro lapideo fatalem hodie lapidem videas circuiri.</I>.

An alternative translation can be found in the Penguin edition(<A href="../../references/DeBarri1187Itinerarium.html" target=bottom>*</A> p.446) in which Thorpe blames the desertion of the hut on the childlessness (which seems to be the implication, though it may be uninhabitable through the frequent use of the site, or it may be that hut was specially built rather than deserted, and, indeed, that the childlessness was put about to lower usage). Thorpe has a separate, and normal, wall surrounding the stone.
