The current status of the church and stone is unknown. 
While the local vicar and antiquarian Henry Rowlands 
rather perculiarly didn't mention the stone in his published works 
(possibly because of its more dubious aspects) 
Colt-Hoare (<A href="../../references/ColtHoare1863Gerald.html">*</A>p.446) indicates that that the stone 
was mentioned in one of Rowlands' manuscripts as being 
in the wall of the graveyard until (recently?) 
stolen, but that by that time it was much reduced in power. This 
matches up somewhat with Gerald's much-edited description 
(See <A href="../myth.html" target=right>Myth</A>).
It is not clear, then, whether when Lewis<A href="../../references/Lewis1849Topographic.html" target=bottom>*</A> reported in 1833 
that the stone was said to have been built into the church 
wall but was "<Q>not sufficiently conspicuous to be easily distinguished</Q>" he was simply confused.

Thomas Pennant, who reported on a visit to the House in the 1770s 
after Rowlands died, said the stone was built into the church(<A href="../../references/Pennant1778TourIII.html" target=bottom>*</A>p.9). 



 Either way, in 1849 Lewis<A href="../../references/Lewis1849Topographic.html" target=bottom>*</A>  reported that:

...the old building...which has been for the most part demolished, was an interesting church, and one of the most important religious structures in the isle of Anglesey. Its situation, also, was somewhat peculiar, it being erected in an inclosure almost circular, surrounded by "tall ancestral trees," and immediately behind the mansion of Lord Boston, from which it was not twenty yards distant. The reasons assigned for its desertion were, that it required so much reparation as to make it more advantageous to raise a new edifice; and next, that the population having shifted to the spot called Bryn Siencyn, it was desirable to choose a site for the new church in that part of the parish.

The reminants of the church remain on private 
land belonging to Llanidan House. It is unclear what happened to the stone; whether it is still in the churchyard wall, still in the chapel, 
or whether it was stolen or removed (along with some of the church fittings<A href="../../references/COFLEIN2004Llanidan.html" target=bottom>*</A>) to the new church at
