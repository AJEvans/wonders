"Cefni" was "Kefenny" in 1766 (<A href="../../references/Rowlands1766Mona.html" target=bottom>*</A>p.16) and "Kyffyn" is recorded as a local name at least once (<a href="../../references/Pennant1778TourIII.html" target="bottom">*</a>p.6). 

The evolution of the name of the valley in the manuscripts 
(<A href="alternatives.html" target=bottom>Note</A>) draws comparison with names like 
"<A href="http://www.multimap.com/maps/?countryCode=GB#map=53.89122,-1.69391|14|4&dp=904&bd=useful_information&loc=GB:53.89643:-1.67322:14|Otley|" target=_new class=place>The&nbsp;Chevin</A>" in 
West Yorkshire and  

the "<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9vennes" target=_new>C&#233;vennes</A>" in France (which 
probably gave their name to the local <I>Chenin</I> grapes, who's name matches one 
of the manuscript variations).  



As unlikely as it seems for a river, the name is probably from the 
same derivation as modern Welsh  
<I>Cefnen</I> ["Ridge","Hillock";"Bank"]&dagger;; one can only presume because the stream 
runs through such a ridge-strewn area or below the prominent ridge now 
followed by the 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/maps/?countryCode=GB#map=53.17828,-4.33749|15|4&dp=904&bd=useful_information&loc=GB:53.21678:-4.33016:14|Malltraeth|" target=_new class=place>B4421</A> (<I>Cefn Mawr</I>?). It seems likely that an appropriate translation for the wonder would actually be "<I>walks at night-time above 
the valley of the ridge(s)</I>".

</P>
<P>
&dagger;Also, possibly <I>Cefn</I> "Back". Though "Cenin" c.876+&nbsp;<span class="smallcaps">CE</span> in Book of Llan D&#226;v (<A href="../../wonder6/notes/others.html" target=bottom>Note</A> from <A href="../../wonder6/index.html" target=right>Wonder&nbsp;6</A>) seems to suggest a final "n" has been lost, the variations are too great to 
really draw a distinction, nor is the difference important as <I>Cefn</I> is equally used to describe back-like ridges and hills.
