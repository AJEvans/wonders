You can get an idea of the view Gerald would first have had of 
Bank-y-Warren by stopping at 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/maps/?&t=l&map=52.1016332846366,-4.60030906017877|15|4&loc=GB:52.1016332846366:-4.60030906017877:15&dp=841#t=l&map=52.05465,-4.63141|14|4&dp=841&loc=GB:52.05465:-4.63141:14|cilgerran|Cilgerran,%20Cardigan,%20Dyfed,%20Wales,%20SA43%202" target=_new class=place>Cilgerran</A> 
as he did, and then driving west and north on the A478. The hill has the same slightly-unnatural distinctiveness as 
Glastonbury, and if one was told it was a burial mound it would be easier to believe than that it was natural 

(<A href="photos/crugmawr-distance.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>). 

However, the best few of the mound is from

the road running west of the town passing straight through one side of it.

The nearest burial mound that has been recorded was actually a few hundred metres away, though 
it is now missing from modern maps. The location was just right of the T-junction in the footpaths, 
north-east of the label "sand pit" on this 
location on this <a href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&amp;X=220000&amp;Y=247500&amp;width=700&amp;height=400&amp;gride=221139.697020037&amp;gridn=247893.474596949&amp;srec=0&amp;coordsys=gb&amp;db=freegaz&amp;addr1=&amp;addr2=&amp;addr3=&amp;pc=&amp;advanced=&amp;local=&amp;localinfosel=&amp;kw=&amp;inmap=&amp;table=&amp;ovtype=&amp;keepicon=true&amp;zm=0&amp;scale=50000&amp;multimap.x=396&amp;multimap.y=182" target="_new" class="place">Map</a>. 
You can walk along to the junction of the footpaths on the edge of the sandpit and check it out; in actual fact, despite not being marked on the map, there is a considerable 
mound still there (<a href="photos/crugmawr-sandpit-vr.html" target="right" class="photo">VR&nbsp;View</a>). Of course, a mound isn't necessarily a tumulus, but it looks 
pretty much like one. In addition, people living near the sandpits note that a student archaeology team from one of the Universities has apparently been dug up a burial mound they'd 
identified from air-photographs
on the hill next to Bank-y-Warren (<A href="photos/crugmawr-location.html" target=right class=photo>Location&nbsp;Photo</A>). 
There doesn't seem to be any evidence of this now  (<A href="photos/crugmawr-dig.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>) and it would be interesting to 
hear who was involved.
