One might ask why this wonder is so far from the others in South Wales, which are 
largely around the Severn. 
Cardigan was plainly a strategic spot, the <I>Brut Y Tywysogion</I><A href="../../references/Ithel1860Brut.html" target=bottom>*</A> for 1200 describes it 
as <Q>...Aberteivi, the key to all Wales...</Q> (as Williams ap Ithel's 
version conflates several manuscripts it is not obvious which version of the 
Brut this appears in, but it is not in 
Peniarth 20<A href="../../references/Jones1952Brut.html" target=bottom>*</A>). This importance 
is likely to have been the case even before the Norman castle was built there in 1093, as the west 
coast of Wales provides one of the few lowland routes from South to North Wales, as well as 
routes to Eire.
