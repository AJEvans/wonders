The modern identification of Banc-y-Warren with Crug Mawr, and the battle site, chiefly rests on this 
quotation by Lewis<A href="../../references/Lewis1849Topographic.html" target=bottom>*</A>:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Soon after the death Henry I, a memorable battle was fought near Cr&ucirc;g Mawr, a conical hill in this parish [Llangoedmore], between the Welsh, commanded by Grufydd ab Rhys and the English, in which the latter sustained a signal defeat.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Which would lead one to expect that one of the Welsh or Norman histories would include a 
clear description of the hill and its location. However, this seems not to be the 
case. History-centred sources tend to identify the battle as being at 
Aberteif(/v)i. Here is the entry from the B and C versions of the 
<I>Annales Cambriae</I><A href="../../references/Ithel1860Annales.html" target=bottom>*</A> (See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other&nbsp;Works</A>) with a rough translation. The latter parts of B and C 
may date from 1286 and 1288 respectively:

1135. The ensuing year, Rickert, son of Gilbert {Richard Fitz-Gilbert}, was slain by Morgan, son of Owain. After that, Owain and Cadwalader, the sons of Gruffudd, son of Cynan, led a large and cruel army into Ceredigion; —the men who were the ornament of all the Britons, their safety, their liberty, and their  strength ;  the men who were two noble and two generous kings ; {/like two kings, like two generous ones,} two dauntless ones ; two brave lions{/ones}; two blessed ones; two eloquent{/pleasant} ones ; two wise ones; protectors of the churches,   and   their champions;  the  defenders of the poor ; the slayers of the foes; the pacifiers of the quarrelsome ; the tamers of antagonists ;  the safest refuge  to   all  who  should flee   to   them;   the   men who   were   pre-eminent   in energies of souls and   bodies ;  and jointly upholding in unity the whole kingdom of the Britons {/held supremacy over all Wales}.    They on the first onset burned the castle of Walter de Bec; and   then,   having  moved their   wings,   they   fought against  the  castle  of   Aberystwyth  and   burned   it; and along with Howel, son of Maredudd, and Madog, son  of Idnerth, and the two sons of Howel, to wit, Maredudd and Rhys, [and Rhys ap Madawc ap Ednerth] they burned the castle of Eickert de la Mere {Richard de la Mare}, and the castle of Dinerth, and the castle of Caerwedros;  and afterwards  they  returned   home. In the   close   of that  year  they  came a second time into Ceredigion, having   with them a numerous  army of choice combatants, about six thousand fine infantry, and two  thousand one  hundred {/2000} {mailed} cavalry   in   armour. And to  their aid   came   Gruffudd,   son of  Rhys,   and Howel,   son of Maredudd of Brecheiniog,   and  Madog, son of Idnerth, and the  two sons of Howel, son of Maredudd   [they over-ran the county, as far as Aberteifi, restoring all the former inhabitants to their proper inheritances, and 
discarding all such strangers as the late Earl of Strygil 
had placed in the country]. And  all those   conjointly drew  up their troops at  Aber Dyvi [See below].    And to   oppose  them came Stephen the constable of the town, and Robert, son of Martin {Robert Fitz-Martin}, and the sons of Gerald the steward, and William son  of Orc {/Odo}[/John],  and all the  Flemings,   and   all the  marchers,  and  all the   French  from   Aber  Nedd {the Neath}
unto Aber Dyvi [See below] [and meeting with the Welch berwixt Aber Ned and Aber Dyfi]. And after joining battle, with cruel fighting on every side, the Flemings and the Normans took to flight, according to their usual custom [trusting too much to the strength of their towns and fortifications, 
began to look how to save themselves that way]. [But the Welch 
pressed upon them so hard, that they killed above 3000 men] And after some of them had been killed, and others burned, and the limbs of the horses of others broken {/and others trampled under horses' feet}, and others taken captive, and the greater part, like fools, drowned in the river, and after losing about three thousand of their men, they returned exceedingly sorrowful to their country. After that, Owain and Cadwalader [over-ran the 
whole county, forcing all the Normans and Flemings to depart the country with all speed, and placing in their room those 
miserable Welch, who had been so long deprived and kept from their 
own extates; and after they had weeded the country of those 
insatiable caterpillars, they] returned, happy and rejoicing, to their country, having obtained the victory honourably with an immense number of prisoners, and spoils, and costly garments and arms.

Here the situation is even worse, as it isn't even clear the location is Aber Teivi. The 
various versions of the Brut have different readings<A href="../../references/Jones1952Brut.html" target=bottom>*</A>. For the location the troops converge on, 
Peniarth 20 has <I>Aberteuii</I>, 
while the Red Book of Hergest version has <I>Aber Teiui</I>, and the <I>Brenhinedd y Saesson</I>  
has <I>Aberteiui</I><A href="../../references/Jones1952Brut.html" target=bottom>*</A>. While these seem conclusive, the later location between which the 
Norman forces are collected between runs from Peniarth 20 and the Red Book's <I>Aber Dyvi</I> 
to the <I>Brenhinedd y Saesson</I>'s manuscript B<A href="../../references/Jones1952Brut.html" target=bottom>*</A> (Black Book of Basingwerk) <I>Aber Tevi</I>. Moreover, the 
<I>Brenhinedd y Saesson</I>'s 
manuscripts both have this as where there soliders come <I>to</I>, not <I>from</I><A href="../../references/Jones1952Brut.html" target=bottom>*</A> (somewhat in line with Powel's version), that is 
there is a line which could argue for <I>Aber Dyvi</I> 
[<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-4.04630&GridN=52.54380&lon=-4.04630&lat=52.54380&place=Aberdyfi%2C%20Gwynedd&db=freegaz&scale=100000&search_result=Aberdyfi%2C%20Gwynedd&lang=&db=freegaz&keepicon=" target=_new class=place>Aberdovey</A>] 
as the location. Note also the difference with the <I>Annales</I> which have "between the Severn and St.David's".
</P>
<P>
However, it is generally accepted that these <I>Bruts</I> are all based on a Latin original 
which was, in turn, based on the <I>Annales Cambriae</I> manuscript B. Given this, we are somewhat 
justified in accepting the location as around Cardigan, and the variations as transcription and 
translation errors.

The battle also appears in the continuation of the Chronicle of Florence of 
Worcester by John of Worcester (though the actual addition was by the G<SUP>2</SUP> 
continuator of McGurk<A href="../../references/McGurk1998Florence.html" target=bottom>*</A> at some 
time after 1146<A href="../../references/McGurk1998Florence.html" target=bottom>*</A>).

Another bloody battle was afterwards fought at Cardigan, in the second week of the 
month of October, in this same year [1136], in which the slaughter was so great that, 
without reckoning the men who were carried off into captivity, there remained 
ten thousand women, whose husbands, with numberless children, were either drowned, or 
burnt, or put to the sword. When the bridge over the Tivy was broken 
down it was a wretched spectacle to see crowds passing to and fro across a bridge formed by 
the horrible mass of human corpses and horses drowned in the river.

Here then, there seems some confirmation that the results of the battle at least spilled into 
the town. Interestingly, this description is very different from that of the Welsh sources, 
and doesn't seem related to them. As is could have been written within ten years of the 
event, it is a strong source. Different again is the description in the near-contemporary 
<I>Gesta Stephani</I> ("The Deeds of [King] Stephen"; c.1148). Here's the translation by 
Potter<A href="../../references/PotterDavis1976Gesta.html" target=bottom>*</A>:

When this was spread abroad, namely, that the principal man set over the Welsh 
[Richard Fitz Gilbert] had fallen; gathering from the different districts into a huge army they 
invaded his land, dividing themselves into three terrible bands methodically and with a view 
to war, and surrounded on three sides and routed Richard's own knights with the addition of some others who 
to the number of three thousand, including foot-soldiers, had assembled to help them from the 
neighbouring towns and castles; pursuing them in energetic and spirited fashion with shouts and arrows 
they pitifully slaughtered some, others they massacred by driving them violently into a river, a good 
number they put in houses and churches to which they set fire and burnt them, and 
roving as plunderers through the whole district, which extends for thirty-six miles, they left nothing 
remaining in it; old men they exposed to slaughter or mockery; the young of both 
sexes they delivered over to chains and captivity; women of any age they shamelessly 
abandoned to public violation...when the Welsh were troubling the land in this fashion, it seemed 
to the king that he was striving in vain, in vain pouring out his vast treasure to reduce them to peace; and 
so, advised by more judicious counsel, he 
preferred to endure their insolent rebellion for a time, in order that, with fighting at a 
stand-still and disagreement setting them all at variance, they might either suffer a famine or 
turn on each other and be exterminated by mutual slaughter.

One might imagine he did.

Anyhow, it can be seen that the Histories are not especially clear about the location of the 
battle. Other sources are little better.
The battle probably features in at least two poems of <I>Y Gogynfeirdd</I> 
(<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_poetry" target=_new>Info</A>). Though there were battles in the area before this, the people praised in the full versions of the poems fought at Crug Mawr (Cardigan Castle was developed by the Normans in 1093, also 
1110<A href="../../references/Jones1952Brut.html" target=bottom>*</A>; with early battles there in 
1115<A href="../../references/Jones1952Brut.html" target=bottom>*</A> [possibly]; 
1116<A href="../../references/Ithel1860Brut.html" target=bottom>*</A> [1113 in MS]; 
1145<A href="../../references/Jones1952Brut.html" target=bottom>*</A>;
1165<A href="../../references/Jones1952Brut.html" target=bottom>*</A> [fought by Rhys, who rebuilt the 
castle in 
1171<A href="../../references/Jones1952Brut.html" target=bottom>*</A>]).

The poems seem to have been written for an audience that 
would have a critical understanding of the battle: for 
example, they give a more realistic total for the dead 
than the <I>Bruts</I> (though this may be just on the Welsh side), but they still do not locate the 
battle on the mountain. In defense of a mountain location, however, the latter poem does 
compare the battle with the battle of Baddon, which is 
given as a mountainside battle [<I>Monte Badonis</I>] in the section of 
the <I>Historia</I> on Arthur's battles 
(See <A href="../../history/contents.html" target=right>Contents</A>).

<P>
The only clear reference that infact connects the 
battle with Crug Mawr is from the travel diary of 
Gerald of Wales<A href="../../references/DeBarri1187Itinerarium.html" target=bottom>*</A>. However this is also likely to be a  
reliable source as, firstly, the site was probably 
pointed out by a local, and, more importantly, Gerald wrote just within living 
memory of the battle (51 years later) so the local may have remembered it:

On this spot Gruffydd, son of Rhys ap Tewdwr, soon after the death of king Henry I., by a furious onset gained a signal victory against the English army, which, by the murder of the illustrious Richard de Clare, near Abergevenny (before related), had lost its leader and chief.  A tumulus is to be seen on the summit of the aforesaid hill, and the inhabitants affirm that it will adapt itself to persons of all stature and that if any armour is left there entire in the evening, it will be found, according to vulgar tradition, broken to pieces in the morning.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
That a battle would take place on the 
mountain rather than next to the castle may seem unlikely, however mountainside battles appear common in both the 
<I>Bruts</I> and <I>Annales</I>. 


While there is a plain strategic advantage to 
the army higher up the mountain (see the four chapters on mountain fighting in von&nbsp;Clausewitz<A href="../../references/Clausewitz1873War.html" target=bottom>*</A>), it is not clear why forces would leave a fortified area 
to engage in a battle when this advantage is clearly against them. However, it appears from the 
sources that armies on both sides at that time encamped on hillsides for defence [see 1159<A href="../../references/Jones1952Brut.html" target=bottom>*</A> for a Welsh example; 1165<A href="../../references/Jones1952Brut.html" target=bottom>*</A> for a Norman one], 
and it is possible that an attacking army would aim to surprise an encamped 
army at rest, either directly or from the lee of the hill. It is also clear  
that the Welsh were using cavalry in the battle. While cavalry on a hill is   
apparently a fearful thing to see charging towards 
you<A href="../../references/Lippitt1865Three.html" target=bottom>*</A>, they would be extremely 
unwieldy, and a commander with some guts may have tried to use this to 
their advantage. The final possibility is that Rhys ap Gruffudd was laying seige to 
the castle when reinforcements arrived, forcing him to retreat to a more strategic location where his back wasn't against the 
river. He showed exactly this behaviour in 1159 when he left the castle of 
Carmarthen, which he had in seige, and moved to the mountain <I>Cefn Rhestr Main</I> when reinforcements 
arrived to relieve the castle. From this location he managed to force a truce without 
fighting<A href="../../references/Jones1952Brut.html" target=bottom>*</A>, however, he may have 
had the sucessful battle at Crug Mawr in mind when setting out his location. The move from 
castle site to mountain would certainly explain the different locations in the 
<I>Annales</I> and Gerald's account.
</P>
<P>
(Finally, as an aside, note that the <I>Bruts</I> give the date as 1135, however, they also give the 
battle as occurring the year after the death of Henry I (indeed, encouraged by it) in 1134. Henry infact died in 1135, making the <I>Annales Cambriae</I>'s date for the battle of 1136 correct. The fact that the <I>Annales</I> C and Peniarth 20 label it "Black Saturday", and the Chronicle of John of Worcester 
gives the date as the second week of October suggested to Lloyd a date of 10th October<A href="../../references/Jones1952Brut.html" target=bottom>*</A>)
