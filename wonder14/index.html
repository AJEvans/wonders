"There is another wonder in the region which is called Cereticiaun. 
There is there a mountain, which is given the name Cruc Maur, and 
there is a grave on the summit of it, and every man whosoever that 
will come to the grave and stretch himself out next to it, 
however short they will be, 
the grave and the man have been found within one length, and, if it will be that the man is 
short and small, similarly also it is found the length of the grave is like 
the height of the man, and, if he will be long and 
tall, even if he might be of length four cubits<SUP><A 
href="notes/cubits.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP> 
near the height of every man so the tumulus is discovered. 
And every wanderer who's up to weariness, the man will bow three bows near that, 
he will not be beyond himself upto his day of death, and he will not 
be weighted down again by any weariness, even if he will go alone 
to the boundaries of the cosmos."

Cruc Mawr ["The Big Hillock/Heap/Tumulus"] is probably the hill

was mentioned, along with the legend of the grave by Gerald of Wales<A href="../references/DeBarri1187Itinerarium.html" target=bottom>*</A> in 1187.
