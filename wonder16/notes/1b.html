It is of interest to know that one of the thirteen wonders of Britain was a quern which ground constantly, except on Sundays, near Mauchline in Kyle. (4) It was heard working under ground. To witness the tradition there is Auchenbrain, c. 1200 (Lib. MeIr.) Acchenebron for Achadh na brón 'field of the quern,' about three miles from Mauchline.

4. 'In treas ingnad deag, bro for bleith do greas im Machlind i Cuil, acht dia domnaig ; fo talmain imorro do cluintear'; Irish Nennius, p. 119.
