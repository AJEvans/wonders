"The thirteenth is a quern which constantly grinds, except or Sunday, in Machlin in Cul. It is heard working under ground. The well of the grain is in Meadon, that is, a well from which grain flows without ceasing."<SUP><A href="notes/1.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>

The first part of this wonder was identified by W.J. Watson, a placename expert in the 1920s, as Acchenebron (now Auchenbrane) field (Achadh na brón 'field of the quern,') about three miles from 
<A href="https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=a8c45d57-d525-41db-89bf-4dd942390e2f&cp=55.518591~-4.408376&lvl=13&imgid=d98dc6bb-a647-43ee-a522-71ba8f1d25ca&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027">Mauchline</A>. The farm has now 
been split up, but a quick trip suggests 
the quern hasn't been heard recently, but the fact that it exists and doesn't grind on Sundays is still well known as local folklore. I had a good listen to the ground on the road near the farms, but sadly couldn't hear a thing...

It isn't clear, sadly, just whether the "well of the grain" is supposed to be in the same area, or a completely separate wonder; it seems likely it may be a separate wonder, actually associated with the 
next wonder in our list.
