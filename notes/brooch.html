This picture is of the Hunterston Brooch, from West Kilbride. It is probably from 
7th to 8th Century Southern Scotland, and shows a mix of Pictish, British and Anglo-Saxon 
styles, and therefore symbolises the "Wonders" of Nennius admirably. You can find out more 
about it at the University of North Carolina's <A href="http://www.unc.edu/celtic/catalogue/brooches/hunterston.html" target=_new>Celtic 
Arts and Cultures site</A>.
