The only memory of the name <I>Pwll Helyg</I> in Tongwynlais near Cardiff 
is as the name of a road some distance from the original spot 
(<A href="photos/cardiff-road.html" class=photo>Photo</A>). However, a couple of kind locals who live near the road 
recalled playing around two ponds in the 1950s. 
One was "in the hollow down where the motorway now is" and another 
was "further in towards Cardiff, around where the cemetery is" - 
though they suggested the former was probably drained and under the road.

this pond is likely to have been <I>Pwll Helyg</I> though overlays of 
the two maps give enough leeway for the pool to be either by or 
under the motorway.

Despite the building of the roads around it, there is 
still a mossy patch of saturated land within the roundabout where the A470 connects  
with the M4 Motorway 
(<A href="photos/cardiff-location.html" class=photo>Location Photo</A>). The 
ground has been disturbed to the point where the 
only remains of what would have been cottages are some 
masonry lumps, and the original vegetation has been 
removed. However, new willows have started growing there 
(possbly accounting for the name: see Note on <A href="notes/helic.html" target=bottom>Helic</A>)
and the ground is still wet enough to believe the area 
once held a pond (<A href="photos/cardiff-overview-vr.html" class=photo>VR View looking in</A>).
Even, so, looking at the area you would be justified in 
expecting there to be nothing left of the pool
