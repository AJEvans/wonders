The fact that a pond 
with no connection to a river is full of fish is certainly notable, though fish 
quite often seem to land up in water bodies that seem pretty inaccessible. The 
usual explanation is that they are dropped by birds, though eels have 
been seen migrating across

Another possibility in larger bodies of water is a population surviving as 
the water system changes. For example, although not isolated from rivers and the sea,

a population of European Whitefish known locally as

were probably present in Britain at the end of the last Ice Age (~18-10000 years ago) but 
were competed out, or died out, in warmer and more accessible waters elsewhere.
