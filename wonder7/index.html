"There is another wonder in the region of Cinlipiuc. There is in that place a spring 
called the Well-pool of Guur Helic. No stream flows out of it or into it. Men go to the spring 
to fish - some go to the eastern part of the spring and draw out fish from that part, some 
to the right, some to the left, and the west, and fish are drawn from those parts, and different 
types of fish are drawn from each part. It is a great wonder to find fish in the spring 
while there is no stream flowing in and none out of it, and in there they find four 
types of fish, and by no means is it deep! The depth is at every point to the knees; 
it is twenty foot in length and breadth; the bank is high that holds it from each direction."<SUP><A href="notes/translation.html" target=bottom>1</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/alternatives.html" target=bottom>2</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/finnaun.html" target=bottom>3</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/helic.html" target=bottom>4</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/guur.html" target=bottom>5</A></SUP>

This Wonder is both a biological and watery one. The specific location is currently 
unknown, but the "country of Cinlipiuc" 
is likely to be the old kingdom of 
<I>Cynllibiwg</I> the region between the Severn and the 
Wye<SUP><A href="notes/cinlipiuc.html" target=bottom>6</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/cynllo.html" target=bottom>7</A></SUP>. 
The steep banks around this pool 
and the constant depth suggests this is a constructed 
feature<SUP><A href="notes/natural.html" target=bottom>8</A></SUP>, and 
there are two possible man-made features this might be: a purposefully-built fish-holding   
pool<SUP><A href="notes/fishingpool.html" target=bottom>9</A></SUP>, or a enclosed 
spring<SUP><A href="notes/spring.html" target=bottom>10</A></SUP>. Although no one knows where this 
wonder is, we can suggest three contenders: <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=313750&Y=181750&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=pc&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=5000&right.x=7&right.y=98" target=_new class=place>Pwll-Helyg</A> in Cardiff<SUP><A href="notes/pwlls.html" target=bottom>11</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/others.html" target=bottom>12</A></SUP> (<A href="cardiff.html">Visit Details</A>),
