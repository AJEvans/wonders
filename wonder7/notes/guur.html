<I>Guur</I> might be the modern Welsh <I>G&#373;r</I> ("man"; "husband"). 
Griffen<A href="../../references/Griffen1994Names.html">*</A> (p.85), apparently 
unaware of this use (the other use appears to be in <I>Guurci</I>, see below), discusses 
a hypothetical word <I>*G<U>u</U>ur</I> 
(where the * denotes hypothetical, and the underline a "glide"), which he suggests 
is an early (Brythonic to Old Welsh transition? ~8th C.) form of <I>G&#373;r</I>. 
He suggests that while <I>Gur</I> appears in the oldest (text 'B') copy of the <I>Gododdin</I>, 
(see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target="right">Other Works</A>) the 
<I><U>u</U>u</I> combination never did because the 
way <I>u</I> was pronounced would have rendered it pointless. Koch<A href="../../references/Koch1997Aneirin.html">*</A>, seems to argue otherwise, but also 
suggests <I>Gur</I> scans as <I>Gwwr</I> in early Welsh poetry.
</P>
<P>
<I>Guor</I>, which is the form found in some of the manuscripts (See Note on  
alternative <A href="alternatives.html">Variants</A>) is a common component in Old Welsh compound 
names<A href="../../references/Koch1997Aneirin.html">*</A>, 
suggesting <I>Helic</I> is a name rather than, for example "Willow". 
As a name prefix it is found in the oldest Welsh Genealogies (see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>), 
particularly those associated with Manuscript <A href="../../history/manuscripts.html#A" target=right>A</A> (note, however, that in this manuscript the <I>wonder</I> has <I>Guur</I> not <I>Guor</I>, and the attached <I>Annales Cambriae</I> 
(see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>) also contains  
the name <I>Guurci</I> rather than <I>Guorci</I> [at ~577]).
</P>
<P>
Ford<A href="../../references/Ford2001Cunedda.html">*</A> pulls together the 
genealogies for <I>Cynedda Wledig</I> which shows nicely the use of <I>Guor</I>. While 
he suggests it is a mnemonic used with name repetition (so <I>guor-name</I> and <I>name</I> 
are the same individual) it could equally be being used 
as an honorific (cp. <I>gwr&eth;</I> "manly"<A ref="../../references/Koch1997Aneirin.html">*</A>;
Koch's<A href="../../references/Koch1997Aneirin.html">*</A> hypothesised Brythonic <I>*guorgou</I> "best", leading to today's <I>gorau</I>; and 
<I>guron</I>/(posibly also <I>guoron</I>) "hero" leading to today's <I>gwron</I><A href="../../references/Koch1997Aneirin.html">*</A>) or  
to distinguish a predecessor in a tradition of name repetition (one could note the 
use of <I>cu/gu</I> "beloved/kind/dear" in South Wales in the terms for grandparents 
<I>tad-cu</I> "Dear father", <I>mam-gu</I> "Dear mother",  as a somewhat stretched  
analogy).
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, 
it would seem <I>Guur</I> could be a dictation/transcription of pretty much any of the above, 
or, indeed, something entirely different - for example, given the widespread use of 
springs as boundary markers noted by Jones<A href="../../references/Jones1954Wells.html">*</A> 
(who speculates this may be particually true in the case of well-names containing <I>pen</I> "head" followed by 
a name) it could 
relate through mis-transcription to <I>Cwr</I> "outer 
limit of an area", making it something like "<I>the well-pool at the end of Helig's land</I>". 
We await Vol.10 of Dumville's <i>The Historia Brittonum</i> (see <a href="../translations.html" target="right">Translations</a>) which he 
notes<a href="../../references/Dumville1986Value.html">*</a> will contain a full study by K.H.Jackson of the Welsh language forms.
