<P>The steep sides make it unlikely to be a stock-watering hole. 
Purpose-built fishing pools associated with springs are known even now - for example at

<A href="../../wonder13/index.html" target="right">Wonder 13</A>, though the age of any 
that might be suitable has probably been lost. Roman <I>Piscinae</I> are found in Britain, and 
are often fed by springs, with elaborate piping systems to carry the water 
away<A href="../../references/EHMonumentsFish.html">*</A>. Twenty foot would seem small on the 
basis of currently excavated examples (which are few), but not impossibly so, and, notably, most 
are a consistent depth across their whole 
span, ranging from 0.5-0.8m<A href="../../references/EHMonumentsFish.html">*</A>. A short 
article on Roman fish-ponds can be 
found <A href="http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/668/46777" target=_new>here</A>.
