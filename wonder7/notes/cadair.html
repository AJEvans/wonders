Gerald of Wales<a href="../../references/DeBarri1187Itinerarium.html">*</a> 
(1197 <SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>: <a href="http://www.red4.co.uk/ebooks/itinerary/bk1ch2.htm" target="new">Book 1, Chapter II</a>)  notes that there is a well at the very top of <I>Cadair Arthur</I> ("Arthur's Chair") which 
is square, has no stream running from it, and an occasionally contains trout. 

Arthur's Chair is a somewhat Romantic name for the main two peaks of the Brecon 
Beacons near <I>Cilwhybert</I> and the col/cwm between them. 
The description given by Gerald 
is certainly convincingly like that in the <I>Historia</I>, other than the obvious fact that 
the <I>Historia</I> doesn't mention the mountaintop location. However the wonder was also mentioned 
by Geoffrey of Monmouth (See <A href="../../wonder1/myth.html" target=right>Wonder 1 Myth</A>, 
<A href="../../wonder1/notes/barbarians.html">Note</A>), who sited it in Scotland for narrative reasons. 
Gerald had an bi-polar attitude to Geoffrey's work 
(see, for example, Crick<A href="../../references/Crick1999Geoffrey.html">*</A>), 
and the description he gives seems 
a little too casual - not only would a spring on a mountain top seem pretty odd, but the fish getting there 
would seem to deserve more comment. This might, accurate or not, be a little one-up-manship on 
Gerald's behalf.
