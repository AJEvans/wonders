If, as Paul Remfry<A href="../../references/Remfry2004Kings.html">*</A><A href="../../references/Remfry2004Cynllibiwg.html">*</A> suggests, the name <I>Cynllibiwg</I> means "the land of (St) Cynllo" then it could 
date from as early as the fifth to sixth century<A href="../../references/RadnorForestLlangunllo.html">*</A>, when Cynllo was active in 
mid-Wales, though, of course, it does not necessarily hold that the named Cynllo and 
<I>Saint</I> Cynllo are the same person. No records of St. Cynllo's life exist<A href="../../references/Saints2005Cynllo.html">*</A> to tell us whether he was once a local king (as, for example, in the case of Saint Meurig - see 
<A href="../../wonder11/index.html" target=right>Wonder 11</A>), held the land under tribute,  
or whether the land was simply named by actual or imagined association over a longer period of time. If one needs 
convincing the latter can occur, one only has to drive through modern 
western West Yorkshire, which is now ubiquitously signposted 
"<A href="http://www.bronte-country.com/bcmap1.html" target=_new>Bronte Country</A>".

(<A href="http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/gwynllyw.html" target=_new>life</A>), which ran from "Ffynnon Hen to
