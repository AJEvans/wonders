<P>If we go by name neither <I>Finnaun Guur Helic</I> nor anything like it are found in modern 
lists of enclosed springs/wells (e.g. Jones<A href="../../references/Jones1954Wells.html">*</A> 
or Thomas<A href="../../references/Thomas2004Sacred.html">*</A>), though these 
tend to concentrate on springs that have been used for healing or religious functions, associations 
which are notably absent from <I>Guur Helic</I>. The nearest, for example, is <I>Ffynnon Halog</I> in 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-4.28540&GridN=51.69320&lon=-4.28540&lat=51.69320&db=freegaz&cidr_client=no" target=_new class=place>Pembrey</A>, near Swansea, 
mentioned, with no more detail, by Jones, followed closely by <I>Ffynnon Dilic</I>, Drymma Hill near 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=275000.069702663&Y=195000.053891386&width=500&height=300&gride=275011.069702663&gridn=196883.053891386&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=1&scale=50000" target=_new class=place>Neath</A> in the 
<I>Cilybebyll</I> District, which, according to the c.1600 Peniarth Manuscript 118, was associated with <I>Bedh Dilic Gawr</I> ("the grave of the giant Dilic"). Neither of which are particually convincing options. For 
more convincing pools with appropriate names but the wrong location 
see Notes on <A href="pwlls.html">Pwlls</A> and <A href="others.html">Others</A>. For pools which are in roughly the right area, but with other names, 
see Note on <A href="size.html">Size</A>.
