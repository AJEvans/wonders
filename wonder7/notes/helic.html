<I>Helic</I> is probably the (Brythonic? i.e. before ~8th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN>) name <I>Helig</I>. 
<I>Helig</I> is a frequent component of placenames in Wales.  
Though it could be (and often is) "Willow" (modern Welsh <I>Helyg</I>), in this case the prefix <I>Guur</I> 
makes it likely it is being used as a personal name (See Note on <A href="guur.html">Guur</A>), rather than to mean "Willow Pool", for example.    
Equally, it seems unlikely the name is 
related to the placename component <I>Heli</I> which probably denotes brine (Though 
see Note on <A href="pwlls.html">Pwlls</A>). 
The use of <I>Helig</I> as a name appears in the triad "The three kingdoms destroyed by the 
sea" which notes the destruction of the the land of <I>Helig ab Glannog</I> 
(See <A href="../../wonder6/index.html" target=right>Wonder&nbsp;6</A> Note on 
<A href="../../wonder6/notes/llion.html" target=bottom>Floods</A>). The triad is first known from the 13th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN>, 
but other elements of it refer to the "Dark-Age".  
The name also appears in a number of genealogies, though some of these seem to trace 
back to the dubious <I>Y Myvyrian Archaiology</I> (See <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>) via, for example, 
Baring-Gould and Fisher<A href="../../references/Bryce1990Lives.html">*</A>.
