<P>
<I>Cinlipiuc</I> is the Old Welsh spelling of <I>Cynllibiwg</I> (See <A href="../../history/welshForms.html" target=right>Welsh&nbsp;Forms</A>). 
The Red Book of the Exchequer 
(a list of, amongst other things, landowners from the 12th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN> onwards) 
has "In the time of Rhys ab Owain 'Between Severn and Wye' was called Cynllibiwg (Kenthlebiac)"<A href="../../references/Remfry2004Kings.html">*</A>. Rhys ab Owain ruled from ~1072/1075 to 1078&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../../references/Remfry2004Kings.html">*</A>, though this does not in any sense negate the name being older as the spelling suggests. 
Paul Remfry<A href="../../references/Remfry2004Kings.html">*</A><A href="../../references/Remfry2004Cynllibiwg.html">*</A> gives a detailed discussion of this region.
