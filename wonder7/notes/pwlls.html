<P>
There are three possible <I>Pwll Helig</I>s in Wales, all of which are in the 
wrong location if <I>Cynllibiwg</I> was <I>North</I> of the Wye: 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=313750&Y=181750&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=pc&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=5000&right.x=7&right.y=98" target=_new class=place>Pwll-Helyg</A> in Cardiff is/was approximately the right 
size (see <A href="../cardiff.html" target=right>Visit Details</A>). It possibly remains as a dried hollow under the M4 motorway. 


<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=306000.228883473&Y=194000.97154165&width=500&height=300&gride=306466.228883473&gridn=193798.97154165&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=25000&up.x=190&up.y=3" target=_new class=place>Pwll-Helyg/Helig</A> near Ynysybwl is better known. While maps back to 
<A href="http://www.old-maps.co.uk/servlets/DirectMap2?easting=303000&northing=195600&county=10glamo481" 
class=place target=_new>1884</A> don't appear to show a pool at this location, suggesting the name 
might refer to a deep area of the nearby river, they do show a well close by on the opposite 
bank. 

<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=295000&Y=170000&width=500&height=300&gride=296925.353448198&gridn=168819.210495842&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=50000&multimap.x=235&multimap.y=90" target=_new class=place>Pwll-Helyg/Helig/Elech</A> near Llantwit Major appears to have been destroyed by a railway cutting and 
bridge, though the location can be seen on the 
<A href="http://www.old-maps.co.uk/servlets/DirectMap2?easting=296700&northing=168700&county=10glamo481" class=place target=_new>1885</A> map. It seems too large and irregular to be our location.

Additionally there are two that are much less likely:
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=262500&Y=297500&width=500&height=300&gride=262285&gridn=296847&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=pc&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=LL350SH&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=1&scale=25000" target=_new class=place>Pwll-Helig</A> near Aberdovey is too far off track (though it 
is not marked on maps as such, see, for example, 
this <A href="http://www.agriculture-uk.net/Davies_E_E_Aberdovey.htm" target=_new>Address</A>). Secondly, there is a strong folklore that 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/places.cgi?client=public&lang=&advanced=&quicksearch=Pwllheli" target=_new class=place>Pwllheli</A> was set up by a man called Helig, and the name has become 
shortened, however, it seems more likely that this name relates to <I>Heli</I> 
(modern Welsh for "Brine"). Of course, it is quite possible both that similar sites have disappeared 
or that the sites above have relatively recent names.
