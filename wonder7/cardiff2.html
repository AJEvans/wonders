The area doesn't look like anything would have been 
left after the motorway construction, however, amazingly, 
a brief root around in the trees just next to the motorway 
flyover  
turned up a circular, roughly flat-bottomed hollow, and more than that, one 
about twenty feet across, with steep banks slightly higher than 
the surrounding ground level, and which would, 
if filled with water to normal ground level, have been 
about knee deep. In the absence of the new drainage caused 
by the motorway and roads, it would probably has filled 
nicely from the local watertable, and, indeed, there were 
no signs of inlets or outflows from it 
(<A href="photos/cardiff-outpool-vr.html" class=photo>VR View looking in</A>).

Before getting too excited, however, a few facts should 
be noted. Firstly, the pool is well outside the area 
stated for <A href="index.html">Wonder 7</A>. Secondly, 
there is the remains of a large tree of at least 100 years' age 
in the centre of the hollow (<A href="photos/cardiff-inpool-vr.html" class=photo>VR View stood in centre</A> - 
stump under viewer). The general decay of the tree 
suggests it was felled when the motorway was built. 
While the tree is an interesting sign that the hollow was 
in existance before the motorway, and was conspicuously the only thing 
left when everything around it was leveled, it might 
make having the hollow water-filled in the 1950s problematic.

In all, the site has a lot of plus points, 
but it's still a pretty doubtful location.
