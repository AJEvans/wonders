While the Two Kings of the Severn don't have the crowd-pleasing obviousness of the main bore  
they are, infact, the most interesting and awe-filling of the bore's many features, and seeing them 
doesn't preclude one from seeing the bore as it races down the rest of the river. To see the 
Two Kings, go on one of the major Spring bores 
(<A href="../severn/viewing.html" target=right>Dates</A>). Park in 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=373000&Y=208000&width=700&height=400&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=&zm=0&scale=25000&up.x=359&up.y=6" target=new class=place>Fretherne</A> and take the footpath to Hock Cliff 
(<A href="photos/noose-hockcliff.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A> from cliff prior to bore), walking down from the 
cliff-top east along the Severn way until you are at beach-level. You can sit on the sea-defenses and 
watch the bore come in (certainly in March 2007 the bore didn't get near breaching them, though at other times, who knows?).

The Two Kings appear twice in this area. From the first sea defenses you get a good view of the 
bore as it comes down the main western channel and hits another branch of itself coming over the mudflats 
further west (<A href="photos/noose-mudflats-vr.html" target=right class=photo>VR&nbsp;View</A>). 
You can then jog down further east in time to see the main western channel flow curve back up the 
eastern channel of the Noose (<A href="photos/noose-twokings-vr.html" target=right class=photo>VR&nbsp;View</A>) and hit the eastern channel flow as described 
(<A href="photos/noose-twokings-meet.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>). 
This is easily the most impressive
sight on the bore, building wave upon wave of chaos 
(<A href="photos/noose-twokings-mix.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>) until finally the bore fills the estuary and 
the upstream flow wins over and the Kings move north 
(<A href="photos/noose-twokings-merge.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>). The Noose seems a viable crossing 
place for the Severn as the water level is normally low, but anyone stuck on the high mudflats 
when the bore came through would be unlikely to survive the meeting of the Kings.

After the Kings have clashed, you have plenty of time to get back to your car and drive safely to  
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=373000&Y=209000&width=700&height=400&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=&zm=0&scale=25000&up.x=357&up.y=9" target=_new class=place>Framilode</A> to see the bore-proper there 
(you'll probably have a 20-30 min wait when you arrive), and again at 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=377000&Y=217000&width=700&height=400&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=&zm=0&scale=25000&downright.x=714&downright.y=428" target=_new class=place>Stonebench</A> 
(<A href="photos/stonebench-before.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>), where the bore-proper is at 
its most spectacular (<A href="photos/stonebench-during.html" target=right class=photo>Photo</A>).
