"Another wonder is the Duo Rig Habren, that is the two kings of the Severn. When the sea is 
flooded to The Teared [the bore] within the mouth of the Severn, two waves of spume separately 
convene and make war between themselves in the manner of sea-rams and each proceeds to the other and 
they collide at one another and again withdraw one from another and again they proceed on each Teared [bore]. 
This they do from the initiation of the world all the way to the present day."<SUP><A href="notes/translation.html" target=bottom>1</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/alternatives.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>

This is a watery wonder - one of the three references to the Severn Bore (see the <A href="../severn/science.html">Science</A> page to find out about this) in the Wonders. The Tidal Bore Research 
Society<A href="../references/AnonTBRSSevern.html" target=bottom>*</A> suggest that there are/were only two places on the Severn where the Bore wave can collide with itself
to produce the <I>Duo Rig</I> [Modern Welsh: <I>Dau Rhi Hafren</I>]. Currently it can be seen in the eastern channel of the

Previously, it could also be seen at
