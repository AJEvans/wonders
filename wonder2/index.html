<P>
As a <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=295000&Y=290000&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=100000&right.x=7&right.y=98" target=_new class=place>River Trannon</A> ends the <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=360000&Y=210000&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=1&scale=500000" class=place target=_new>River Severn</A>, this is likely to describe the Severn Bore (see the <A href="../severn/science.html">science</A> page for more on this). The Severn has changed a good deal since our list was compiled - there are now weirs<SUP><A href="notes/weirs.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP> 
in the bore's way<SUP><A href="notes/rangenow.html" target=bottom>4</A></SUP>. However, despite there being less obstacles then,  
it is still unlikely the bore would have reached 
the Trannon. The idea that the bore could filled the mighty Severn also now seems odd, however, the current weirs also  

dam water higher up the river than before. Prior to this it was 
shallower<SUP><A href="notes/navigation.html" target=bottom>5</A></SUP>, for example, at 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=385000.714600834&Y=255000.603561473&width=500&height=300&gride=384968.714600834&gridn=254839.603561473&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=1&scale=500000" target=_new class=place>Worcester</A> 
the Severn <Q>was often a shallow stream, save where pools existed in its bed, or where a channel a few feet wide had been dredged, and held stagnant water.<A href="../references/Anon2002Withybed.html" target=bottom>*</A></Q>
<P>
At such a place, it is easy to imagine the bore rushing up the river, overflowing the meagre channels 
to fill the river to the banks<SUP><A href="notes/rangethen.html" target=bottom>6</A></SUP>. All this suggests that 
the Trannon is either confused with the Severn, or, that the definition of the starting 
point of the Trannon has changed over the years<SUP><A href="notes/others.html" target=bottom>7</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/hodni.html" target=bottom>8</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/neptune.html" target=bottom>9</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/name.html" target=bottom>10</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/trisanton.html" target=bottom>11</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/taratyr.html" target=bottom>12</A></SUP>.
