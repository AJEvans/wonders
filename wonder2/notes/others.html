Equally, we may have completely the wrong river. For example, 
Camden<A href="../../references/Camden1607Britannia.html">*</A> 
<A href="http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/wilshireeng.html#hants4" target=_new>suggests</A>, 
by way of Ptolemy's (see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>) River <I>Trisantonis</I> 
and a convoluted play on the names of Southampton and Andover, the <A href="client=public&X=437000&Y=114000&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=25000&up.x=184&up.y=4" target=_new>River Test</A> in Hampshire (for a discussion see 
Hants.Gazetteer<A href="../../references/Hants2001Test.html">*</A>). 
The Test is now so altered as to be impossible to tell whether it had a bore, though the 
shape of Southampton Water, which it enters, is suitable and the 
river must have been partly tidal (the fields above Testwood still flood at 
Spring tides<A href="../../references/EA2004Test.html">*</A>). 
</P>
<P>
In actual fact, the <I>Trisantonis</I> is more likely to be the Sussex Arun, who's old name appears in 
"Tarrant Street" in Arundel. 
It appears as the <I>Tarente</I> in a Saxon deed of c.725&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../../references/MawerSenton1929Placenames.html" target=bottom>*</A>, a name 
that was still in use in 1279<A href="../../references/MawerSenton1929Placenames.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
There is no evidence there was ever a bore (or anything that might give the wonder) on the river - nothing, for example, 
appears in the extensive description of the river from 1637<A href="../../references/Howard1637Arun.html" target=bottom>*</A>. 
</P> 
<P>
Whichever river is Ptolemy's <I>Trisantonis</I> it would only be one of the many rivers of this and similar 
names collected by Cole<A href="../../references/Coles1994Trisantona.html">*</A> 
(See Note on <A href="trisanton.html">Trisanton</A>). Of these (which include the Trannon), 
the strongest 
candidate would seem to be the major northern-British 
Trent. In addition, if we accept that it is a tidal bore is being described, of the rivers that 
carry one (other than the Severn) only the Trent would 
seem likely to have a bore that could be large enough and a name that was close enough, 
though Morecambe Bay might qualify through 
the fact that, of all of them, it is the only area that actually fills from top to bottom rapidly. 
In the case of the Trent, village names like 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-2.1913&GridN=52.9666&lon=-2.1913&lat=52.9666&db=freegaz&cidr_client=none&lang=&place=Trentham,Stoke-on-Trent&pc=&advanced=&client=public&addr2=&quicksearch=Trentham&addr3=&scale=100000&addr1=" target=_new>Trentham</A> suggest the river had a similar name at least as far back as the Saxons (as suggested by Camden<A href="../../references/Camden1607Britannia.html">*</A> :  
<A href="http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/warkseng.html#staff5" target=_new>Staffordshire</A>). 
Bede (see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>), more closely to our wonder, 
records it as the <I>Traanta</I> or <I>T[a?]'ranta</I><A href="../../references/Ikins2005Trent.html">*</A>, while 
Ptolemy (2nd&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN>) lists it as <I>Gabranto-</I>, which is 
easily a transcription error in the Greek from <I>Tarranto-</I><A href="../../references/Ikins2005Trent.html" target=bottom>*</A>.
Even so, the Trannon, despite the immediate lack of a bore, seems closer, name wise.  
</P>
<P>
Note, also, that Ptolemy also 
lists <I>Moricambe</I> (Morecambe Bay) suggesting this name was current well before the <I>Historia</I> was likely to have been written. 
</P>
<P>
In general, bores are delicate things<A href="../../references/DonnellyChanson2002Impact.html">*</A>, and it is possible 
the river discussed no longer carries one.
