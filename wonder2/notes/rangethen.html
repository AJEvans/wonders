It is unclear how far the bore would have reached prior to the 1800s. Apparently 
cargo ships used 
the tide to carry them as far as <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-2.2174&GridN=52.0654&lon=-2.2174&lat=52.0654&db=freegaz&cidr_client=none&lang=&place=Upton+upon+Severn,Worcestershire&pc=&advanced=&client=public&addr2=&quicksearch=Upton+UPON+SEVERN&addr3=&scale=100000&addr1=" target=_new>Upton-upon-Severn</A><A href="../../references/Witt2000Severn.html" target=_new>*</A>. Given the fords at Worcester, 
but the general navigability at this point, and the fact that the tide may reach there 
today, it seems likely the river was at least tidal there. Paintings prior to the 1840s 
(for example Bayliss<A href="../../references/Bayliss1939Views.html">*</A> and 
Harral<A href="../../references/Harral1824Picturesque.html">*</A>) tend to show bankfull conditions so are little use. Camden<A href="../../references/Camden1607Britannia.html">*</A>  
<A href="http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/gloceng.html#gloc1" target=new>quotes</A> Malmesbury's <I>De gestis pontificum Anglorum</I> of 
1125&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN> 
(<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Malmesbury">biography</A>) 
which notes the bore only reaches "the bridge", probably 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-2.2448&GridN=51.8658&lon=-2.2448&lat=51.8658&db=freegaz&cidr_client=none&lang=&place=Gloucester,Gloucestershire&pc=&advanced=&client=public&addr2=&quicksearch=gloucester&addr3=&scale=100000&addr1=" target=_new>Gloucester</A> (the earliest 
recorded bridge there is 1154&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../../references/Witt2000History.html">*</A>, but earlier ones are likely). This would be less distance than now. 
It's possible the bore went further in the past. In its favour is the 
fact that bore waves require little water to maintain form<A href="../../references/Chanson2001Flow.html">*</A>, and there would have been 
less obstacles. Against it is the fact that they need <I>some</I> 
water<A href="../../references/Abbott1956Theory.html">*</A>, and the lower water level in the past would have left stretches of the river with little 
water and almost certainly rapids. While bores of an equivalent size can travel 
100km inland<A href="../../references/Chanson2001Flow.html">*</A>, the Trannon now starts many kilometers upstream, making it unlikely the bore reached it.
