Cole<A href="../../references/Coles1994Trisantona.html">*</A> has suggested the Trannon 
is one of a number of rivers whose names derive from a British Celtic name/term <I>Trisanton[a]</I>. 
That the term was used usually relies on  
Ptolemy  (2nd&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN>: see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>) who gives 
the River <I>Trisantonis</I> (though see the discussion by 
Ikins<A href="../../references/Ikins2005Trent.html">*</A>), and Tacitus (109&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>), who, in his <I>Annals</I>, gives the more 
ambiguous <I>detrahere arma suspectis cunctaque castris Avonam et Sabrinam fluvios cohibere parat</I>. This  
was translated along the lines of "he prepared to disarm all whom he suspected, and to occupy with encampments the whole country to the Avon and Severn" (see, for example 
<A href="http://www.romansonline.com/Src_Frame.asp?DocID=Ann_Bk12_31" target=_new>here</A>) 
until Bradley, who suggested it was rather  
<I>cis Trisantonam</I> which might translate as 
"this side of the Trisantona" (c.p. our <I>Trans Hannoni</I>: <A href="alternatives.html">Note</A>). 
Subsequently, this has usually been taken to refer to the Trent, mainly because it seems 
likely that during the period in question this would have been a possible limit of the Romans' safe influence.

Cole suggests the term is either derived from 
the British for "Strong/Great"-"Path/Wanderer/Flooder/Pourer" or the related "road that crosses [a watershed]" 
(her suggestion). She further suggests that the Tarrant (Sussex Arun), Tarrant (Dorset), 
Trent (Dorset Piddle), Trent Brook (Dorset), Trentan (Badsey Brook, Worcs), Trent (Northern England) and 
the Trannon (Powys) (plus, possibly, the Trisanna of Austria) are all derived from this usage. 
Camden has made the jump from this name to the Wonder (see <A href="others.html">Note</A>) 
however, it seems something of a jump from <I>Trans Hannoni</I> to <I>Trisantona</I> and then 
from there to <I>Tarannon</I> or <I>Traanta</I>/Trent.
