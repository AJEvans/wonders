Certainly there is no particular evidence for a change of name. 
Taylor's<A href="../../references/Taylor1718Montgomeryshire.html">*</A> map of Montgomeryshire (1718&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>) shows the Severn back to its source. Coles<A href="../../references/Coles1994Trisantona.html">*</A> notes that 
the Trannon was known as the <I>Tarannon</I> in the late 16th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN>, though doesn't discuss its relationship with the Severn. If Cole's thesis about the name being related to the 
<I>Trisanton[a]</I> names is correct (See <A href="trisanton.html">Note</A>) 
it is possible the name could have applied to the Severn more generally, however there is apparently 
no other reference to the Severn using this name.
The name <I>Sabrina</I>, which is almost certainly the Severn, 
extends back to Ptolemy (2nd&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN>: see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>), 
while Geoffrey of Monmouth (<I>Historia Regum Britanniae</I> ii.5: see 
<A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>) 
quotes the legend of Habren, who he suggests gave her name to the river, and further 
suggests the name was corrupted to <I>Sabrina</I>
(The Welsh name is the <I>Hafren</I>: Geoffrey seems correct in his suggested 
corruption - for details of the conversion to "Sabrina" and the English 
"Severn" see <A href="http://www.kmatthews.org.uk/arthuriana/severn.html" target=_new>here</A>). Incidentally, 
the legend is that Locrinus, one of the three sons of the first King of Britain, Brutus, became 
ruler over <I>Loegria</I>, that is, approximately England. He fell in love with the King of Germany's 
daughter Estrildis, with whom he had a beautiful daugther, Habren, however, he married 
another woman Gwendolen for political reasons. When he finally left his wife for the German, 
Gwendolen raised an army and killed him. She then drowned Estrildis and Habren in the 
Severn, but stipulated that the river should take Habren's name in honour of her.
