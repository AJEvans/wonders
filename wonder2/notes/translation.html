Translation for this site. The original is <I>"Secundum miraculum; ostium Trans 
Hannoni fluminis, quia in una unda instar montis ad sissam tegit litora, et recedit, ut cetera maria."</I> 
</P>
The original's <I>ad sissam</I> is obscure. Morris<A href="../../references/Morris1980Nennius.html">*</A> translated this as "in the bore", and this fits with its use elsewhere in the text (<A href="../../wonder11/index.html" target=right>Wonder 11</A>), but sadly he left no indication of where this translation came from. Rhys<A href="../../references/Rhys1901Celtic.html">*</A> translates the same word in <A href="../../wonder11/index.html" target=right>Wonder 11</A> as "banks", but this may be hard to reconcile with the use of <I>litora</I> ('banks', 'shoreline') here, unless it is "to the banks it covers the shores". Conversely Koch and Carey<A href="../../references/KochCarey2003Celtic.html">*</A> for the same text seem 
to assume it is the name of a river ("to the Sissa"..."floods the estuary of the above-said river").
</p>
<p>
While doubt is thrown on Morris' translation by the fact that it seems the Irish Nennius don't mention 
the bore at all, the translator may have simply ditched a word they didn't recognised. Färber &amp; Irwin<A href="../../references/FarberIrwin2002Leabhar.html">*</A> 
have the translation "The second wonder is the mouth of the stream Tranon, which is filled from the bottom with one wave, and ebbs like every other sea." Later transcribers of the non-Irish <I>Historia</I> appear to have dropped the term in <A href="../../wonder6/index.html" target=right>Wonder&nbsp;6</A>: see 
<A href="../../wonder6/notes/alternatives.html" target=bottom>Note on Alternatives</A>.

</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether there are other Latin texts noting a bore explicitly, which might give a usage. Chanson<A href="../../references/Chanson2004Mixing.html">*</A> suggests that the Seine Mascaret was noted in the 7th <SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN> but his reference is hard to obtain. It is possibly the mention of the tides in 
Dudo of St. Quentin's <I>Gesta Normannorum</I> (<A href="http://www.the-orb.net/orb_done/dudo/chapter10.html" target=_new>Chapter 10</A>) which relates events from 876 <SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>, but doesn't give the feature a name. 
Note, also, the writer uses <I>ostium</I> (river mouth) rather than <I>aestuarium</I> (tidal estuary).
</P>
<P>
The word doesn't seem an adaptation of Welsh. 
The Welsh for bore is now <I>eger</I>, however, in <I>Culhwch ac Olwen</I> (c.1325&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN><A href="../../references/Gantz1976Mabinogion.html">*</A>) we 
find <I>pan delhei Arthur a'e luoed y uron llifdwr</I>[<A href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html">*</A>line 279] ("when Arthur and his troops came to a cresting flood" [...a giant knife would be used as a bridge]<A href="../../references/Gantz1976Mabinogion.html">*</A>p.145), so it is possible there was no Welsh word for the bore in the Middle Ages, if not before. It seems likely that <I>eger</I> has been picked up from the English "Aegir" (after the Norse god), which is now used only in English for the Trent bore.
</P>
<P>
However, for the sake of this translation, <I>sissam</I> has been assumed to be <I>scissam</I> "teared"; "splited"; "divided". The word also appears in <A href="../../wonder6/index.html" target=right>Wonder 6</A>, and in 
<A href="../../wonder11/index.html" target=right>Wonder 11</A> in <I>sissa Sabrinae</I>, which is translated assuming 
<I>scissa</I> (again "teared": "the teared Severn"). This assumption has a precedent closer to the <I>Historia</I>'s period, 
as it used in a summary of the wonders by Lambert of St Omer 
(See <A href="../../history/otherWonders.html" target=right>Other Lists</A>). It is to be assumed that "teared" is a reference 
to the bore cutting the river into two sections along its rough-cut line, or similar.
</P>
<P>
NB: With this assumption of <I>scissa</I> in mind, it is perhaps worth noting that in the 
Hunt for the Trwch Trwyth from the medieval tale of Culhwch and Olwen 
(<a href="../../twrch/myth.html" target="right">Details</a>), the 
"scissors" of most translations (modern Welsh <I>siswrn</I>) are removed from the boar at the Severn, however, the term used consistently
is actually <I>gw(/u)elleu(/iu)</I> ("shears": modern Welsh <I>gwellau</I>). Note also that the 
Latin for scissors used in the <I>Historia</I> (<A href="../../history/contents.html" target=right>Section 39</A>) 
is <I>forcipe</I> (cf. more standard <I>forfex</I>). It is therefore unlikely the removal of the scissors is 
related, at least by name, to the bore &ndash; though there may be a less explicit link.
