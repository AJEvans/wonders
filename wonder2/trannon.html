The River Trannon is best seen by starting from 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=295000&Y=290000&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=100000&right.x=7&right.y=98" class=place target=_new>Caersws</A> station, and walking up the road out of the village. A few yards after 
the station, the road crosses the Severn, and the confluence of the Trannon and Severn 
can be seen a few hundred metres upstream, looking from the left side of the bridge 
(<A href="photos/trannon-confluence.html" class=photo>Photo</A>). After the bridge, 
take the first left-hand lane, and a mile or so up the road is a small bridge over 
the Trannon, which gives a good view of the river  
(<A href="photos/trannon-upstream.html" class=photo>Upstream Photo</A>,

It has to be said that while it is easy to imagine the stream filling from 
top to bottom in a single wave, it is very hard to imagine it being confused 
with the Severn given the nature of their confluence, and even 
harder to imagine it ever having been effected by the Severn bore.
