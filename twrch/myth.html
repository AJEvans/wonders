The hunting of the great <I>Twrch Trwyth</I> (the "boar Trwyth") features in the 
11<SUP>th</SUP><SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN><A href="../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html" target=bottom>*</A>
Welsh tale "Culhwch (pronounced <I>Kil-hoo-crh</I>) and 
Olwen"<SUP><A href="notes/source.html" target=bottom>1</A>,</SUP><SUP><A href="notes/dates.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>. In the 
tale (<A href="summary.html">Summary</A>), Culhwch, the nephew of Arthur, is cursed into loving the 
beautiful but unattainable daughter of the giant Ysbaddaden 
(pronounced <I>Usbathaden</I>), who will die when his daughter leaves. 
The giant sets him a ridiculous set of <A href="wonders.html">Wonders</A> to gain in preparation for the 
wedding, and Culhwch and Arthur's men set out to find them. One of the 
wonders is the comb and shears that sit between the ears of the 
<I>Twrch Trwyth</I>, a king who has been turned into a giant boar, 
so the giant may be beautified for the wedding.

To do this, they need to rescue the huntsman Mabon from emprisonment 
in <A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=385000.194149784&Y=220000.764074088&width=500&height=300&gride=383240.194149784&gridn=218607.764074088&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=1&scale=500000" target=_new>Gloucester</A>, which they do with the help of the oldest creature in 
Britain - a Salmon<SUP><A href="../wonder6/notes/salmon.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP> who may live in <A href="../wonder6/index.html">Lake Liuan</A>. 
The Salmon carries two of Arthur's men, Kei ("Kay") and Bedwyr ("Bedevere") 
into the prison, and they sneak Mabon out. They then chase after 
<I>Twrch Trwyth</I> in 
a bloody hunt in which vast numbers of men and piglets die (<A href="chase.html">Route</A>). Eventually 
they grab the items, and run the <I>Twrch Trwyth</I> into the 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=360000&Y=210000&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=1&scale=500000" target=_new>Severn</A> and 
out of Wales, probably between 
<A href="../wonder6/index.html">Lake Liuan</A> and the mouth of the 
<A href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=325000.226465842&Y=200000.213026418&width=500&height=300&gride=&gridn=&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=freegaz&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&zm=0&scale=500000&right.x=5&right.y=18" target=_new>mouth of the Wye</A>.   
</P>     
<P>
After all the items have been collected, Culhwch returns to the giant 
for his prize, and Arthur's men "beautify" Ysbaddaden by shaving him to the 
bone, ears and all, before lopping his head off. Everyone else lives happily 
ever after.
