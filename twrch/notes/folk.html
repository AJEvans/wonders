The tale can be regarded as a combination of two pan-European 
folk tale types. In the Aarne-Thompson tale classification [in brackets below] these 
are the "Jealous Stepmother"<A href="../../references/Edel1983Arthur.html">*</A> and "Six go through the World"<A href="../../references/Roberts1991Culhwch.html">*</A> [513A]  
(and possibly the "Magic Flight" [313]<A href="../../references/Roberts1991Culhwch.html">*</A> and the "Giant's Daughter"<A href="../../references/Edel1983Arthur.html">*</A>).

It includes the pan-European motifs: Quests assigned to get rid 
of a hero [H1211]; Tasks assigned to suitors [H335]; Vain attempts to kill a hero [H1510?]; The quest for a beard [H105.4.1?/G303.4.1.8.2?]; Extraordinary companions [F601]; Skillful marksman shoots a fly's eye [F661.5.3]; Skillful 
hearer can hear ant leaving nest 50 miles away [F641.2]; Mighty drinker [F633]; 
Mighty eater [F632]; Extraordinary companions help in 
suitor's tasks[F601.2]; Helpful salmon [B474].</P>

Edel<A href="../../references/Edel1983Arthur.html">*</A> has speculated, 
convincingly, that the important part of the tale is actually 
the Arthurian element, 
and that these folk tales, particularly the list of tasks, 
have been used to hang together previously separate Arthurian tales. 
She has also suggested that the absence of 'real' invasions or problems 
in the text allowed its adoption as a hidden political commentary. 
While this is somewhat speculative, it is interesting to 
note that if, as seems likely, <I>Culhwch ac Olwen</I> is 
a combination of older tales, this makes the version 
we have left the last reminants of the "Great British Folk Epic" 
(as has also be argued for the <I>Llywarch Hen</I> poems and parts of 
the <I>Mabinogi</I><A href="../../references/Hamp1999Mabinogi.html">*</A>). 
Deeply wishful thinking and comparison with the 
apparent folk-epics of the continent, such as parts of the <I>Eddas</I> 
and the <I>Nibelungenlied</I>,  
might lead the more speculative to suggest the author of 
<I>Culhwch ac Olwen</I> was merely fixing the previously whole, but of 
more interest is its comparison with other explicitly constructed 
European folk-epics. Its formation matches closely 
with attempts like Elias Lonnrot's construction of the combined folk-tale 
epic "the Kalevala" (1835 &amp; 1849 <SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>: <A href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/kveng/" target=_new>text</A> &amp; <A href="http://virtual.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=27015" target=_new>information</A>) for Finland, both in the literary attempt to 
synthesize (or re-form) a continuous narrative from disparate 
folk tales, and in its political situation, as a patriotic 
centre-piece at a time when, in different millennia, both 
Finland and the indigenous British were asserting their 
nationality under a past, and possibly current, threat of duress. 
It is, of course, exactly this kind of "Great British Folk Epic" Tolken, 
for example, could have 
followed Lonnrot to produced but tragically mucked up. We are probably 
blessed to have it, in whatever form.
