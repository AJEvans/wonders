<P>
<I>Culhwch's</I> name (~"pig-run", though see note 10 of Bromwich and 
Evans<A href="../../references/BromwichEvans1992Culhwch.html">*</A>) may have led to him being attached to 
an entirely independent tradition of a boar hunt<A href="../../references/Roberts1991Culhwch.html">*</A>. In addition, the 
tale contains two boars, both used for beautifying the giant, which 
may suggest a single original tale about a hunt for a boar for shaving equipment 
that has been copied <I>and</I> merged (or re-merged) with a separate tale 
of the "Hunting of <I>Twrch Trwyth</I>" which had nothing to do with 
grooming, with the aim of drawing the <I>Twrch Trwyth</I> episode into the Culhwch tale (<I>Twrch Trwyth's</I> beautifying properties certainly make the 
least sense of all the tasks). 
The <I>Twrch Trwyth</I> hunt has a stongly onomastic trend<A href="../../references/Roberts1991Culhwch.html">*</A> (i.e. it is used to explain a 
number of placenames), which may either have been part its original purpose, 
added evidence of its 'truth', or a sign of its wide spread 
popularity (in the 
same way as Arthur-named sites today).
