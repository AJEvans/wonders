It might be speculated that this kind of list, 
which seems deeply out of place in an otherwise relatively 
pacy narrative, might survive in such stories as 
a hang-over from oral tradition, where they might be regarded 
as some kind of memory feat. Caesar<A href="../../references/Caesar45Gaul.html">*</A> [caes.gal.6.14] notes that the 
British Celts regarded memory as of paramount importance, and 
that they never wrote anything down (unfortunately for us) 
to improve it. Certainly the Welsh Triads (see, for example, 
Bromwich<A href="../../references/Bromwich1961Trioedd.html">*</A>) 
appear to be mnemonics for storytellers or poets. In part the 
court list is derived from the poem <I>Pa gur yw y porthaur</I><A href="../../references/Roberts1991Culhwch.html">*</A> in 
the Black Book of Carmarthen (see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" 
target=right>Other Works</A>).
