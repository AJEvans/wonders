The tale, at least as far as the written version we have, is at least as 
old as c. 1100&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>CE</SPAN>, though only the subject matter suggests it is 
older<A href="../../references/Roberts1991Culhwch.html">*</A>. Culhwch 
is mentioned in a 9th&nbsp;<SPAN class=smallcaps>C</SPAN> poem 
(debatably)<A href="../../references/Roberts1991Culhwch.html">*</A>, and a number of Arthur's court as related in the tale are 'Dark Age' 
heros of the 'Old North' (i.e. before the North of England was lost to the 
Saxons).
