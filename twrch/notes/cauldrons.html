The power and seizing of cauldrons is paralleled in a 
number of stories from both Wales and Ireland, notably in 
the case of Arthur's Otherworld quest in <I>Preiddeu Annwn</I> ("The 
Spoils of Annwn") and the <I>Branwen</I> tale of the <I>Llyfr Coch Hergest</I>, along with the similar listing in 
<I>Tri Thlws ar Ddeg Ynys Brydain</I> ("The Thirteen Treasures of Britain") 
(for all of which, see <A href="../../history/otherWorks.html" target=right>Other Works</A>). Somewhat speculatively such cauldrons have been equated with the Grail. A summary and discussion of similar stories can be be found in 
Roberts<A href="../../references/Roberts1991Culhwch.html">*</A>.
