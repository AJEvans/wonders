The wonders<SUP><A href="notes/anoeth.html" target=bottom>1</A></SUP>. These are either objects or marvellous helpers who can 
aid in getting them. In most cases it is clear that the owners won't give their 
possessions up, and can't be forced to do so, or won't participate. Still, Culhwch is cockiness personified<SUP><A href="notes/bolstered.html" target=bottom>2</A></SUP>, so he gives it a go. The wonders sucessfully 
gained or performed in the tale are in bold below<SUP><A href="notes/arrangement.html" target=bottom>3</A></SUP>.
